These statements are only predictions and\\ninvolve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” that may cause our or our\\nindustry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or\\nachievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made by or on our behalf are made pursuant to the\\nsafe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of\\nactivity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend, and we do\\nundertake any obligation, to revise or update any of the forward-looking statements to match actual results. Readers are urged to carefully review and\\nconsider the various disclosures made in this report, which aim to inform interested parties of the risks factors that may affect our business, financial\\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\\nOur financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted\\nAccounting Principles (GAAP).\\nAs used in this annual report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and similar references refer to AMERI Holdings Inc., and its subsidiaries together, unless\\nthe context indicates otherwise.\\nOur Company\\nWe specialize in delivering SAP cloud, digital and enterprise services to clients worldwide.\\nSAP is a leader in providing enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software and technologies to enterprise customers worldwide. We deliver a wide\\nrange of solutions and services across multiple domains and industries. Our services center around SAP and include technology consulting, business\\nintelligence, cloud services, application development/integration and maintenance, implementation services, infrastructure services, and independent\\nvalidation services, all of which can be delivered as a set of managed services or on an on-demand service basis, or a combination of both.\\nOur SAP focus allows us to provide technological solutions to a broad and growing base of clients. We are headquartered in Princeton, NJ, and have\\noffices across the United States, which are supported by offices in India. Our model inverts the conventional global delivery model wherein offshore\\ninformation technology (“IT”) service providers are based abroad and maintain a minimal presence in the United States. With a strong SAP focus, our client\\npartnerships anchor around SAP cloud and digital services. In 2017, we signed a strategic partnership agreement with NEC America to offer SAP S/4 HANA\\n(a next generation enterprise system) migration services. This partnership will allow us to offer our clients a broader spectrum of services. We pursue an\\nacquisition strategy that seeks to disrupt the established business model of offshore IT service providers.\\n \\nOur primary business objective is to provide our clients with a competitive advantage by enhancing their business capabilities and technologies with\\nour expanding consulting services portfolio, which is aided by our business acquisitions. Our strategic acquisitions allow us to bring global service delivery,\\nSAP S/4 HANA, SAP Business Intelligence, SAP Success Factors, SAP Hybris and high-end SAP consulting capabilities to a broader geographic market and\\ncustomer base. We continue to leverage our growing geographical footprint and technical expertise to simultaneously expand our service and product\\noffering. With each acquisition, our goal is to identify business synergies that will allow us to bring new services and products from one subsidiary to\\ncustomers at our other subsidiaries. While we generate revenues from the consulting businesses of each of our acquired subsidiaries, we believe that\\n additional revenues will be generated through new business relationships and services developed through our business combinations.\\nBackground\\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in February 1994 as Spatializer Audio Laboratories, Inc., which was a shell company\\nimmediately prior to our completion of a “reverse merger” transaction on May 26, 2015, in which we caused Ameri100 Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware\\ncorporation and our newly created, wholly owned subsidiary, to be merged with and into Ameri and Partners Inc. (“Ameri and Partners”), a Delaware\\ncorporation (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, Ameri and Partners became our wholly owned subsidiary with Ameri and Partners’ former\\nstockholders acquiring a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The Merger was consummated under Delaware law, pursuant to an\\nAgreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of May 26, 2015 (the “Merger Agreement”), and in connection with the Merger we changed our\\nname to AMERI Holdings, Inc. and do business under the brand name “Ameri100”.\\n \\n1\\x0cTable of Contents\\nAmeri Holdings, Inc., along with its eleven subsidiaries, Ameri and Partners, Inc., Ameri Consulting Service Private Ltd., Ameri100 Georgia Inc.\\n(“Ameri Georgia”), Bellsoft India Solutions Private Ltd., Ameri100 Canada Inc. (formerly BSI Global IT Solutions Inc.), Linear Logics, Corp., Ameri100\\nVirtuoso Inc. (“Virtuoso”), Ameri100 Arizona LLC (“Ameri Arizona”), Bigtech Software Private Limited (“Bigtech”), Ameri100 California Inc. (“Ameri\\nCalifornia) and Ameritas Technologies India Private Limited, provides SAP cloud, digital and enterprise services to clients worldwide.\\n \\nOur Industry\\nBackground\\nWe operate in an intensely competitive IT outsourcing services industry, which competes on quality, service and costs.  Though we are able to\\ndifferentiate our company on all of these axes, our India-based capabilities ensure that labor arbitrage is our fundamental differentiator. Most offshore IT\\nservices providers have undertaken a “forward integration” to boost their capabilities and presence in their client geographies (large offshore presence with a\\nsmall local presence). Conversely, large U.S. system integrators focus on “backward integration” to scale and boost their offshore narrative (offshore being\\nthe “back office” for the local operations).  Today, the IT services industry is marked by the following characteristics:\\n \\nCharacteristic  \\nDescription\\nMature Market\\n●\\nMost large global companies have already outsourced what they wanted to outsource.\\n \\n \\n \\nCommoditized\\nBusiness Model\\n●\\nNorth America and Europe continue to be the markets with attractive spending potential. However, increased\\nregulations and visa dependencies prove to be a major drawback of the model.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n●\\nThe benefits realized from the business model are largely based on labor arbitrage, productivity benefits and\\nportfolio restructuring. These contours have changed due to commoditization.\\n \\n \\n \\nInsourcing\\n●\\nExtremely rapid changes in technology are forcing IT services–traditionally an outsourcing business—to adopt\\nan insourcing model.\\n \\n \\n \\nRapid Technology\\nShifts\\n●\\nCloud services, robotic process automation, artificial intelligence and internet of things are increasingly in\\ndemand as part of outsourcing engagements. Smart robots increasingly operate in the cloud, and a ‘labor-as-a-\\nservice’ approach has emerged, as clients and providers find that intelligent tools and virtual agents can be easily\\nand flexibly hosted on cloud platforms.\\n \\n●\\nSocial media, cloud computing, mobility and big data will continue to be mainstays for any IT ecosystem.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n●\\nThe convergence of cloud computing, virtualization (applications and infrastructure) and utility computing is\\naround the corner. The ability of a vendor to offer an integrated basket of services on a SaaS model, will be a key\\ndifferentiator.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n●\\n \\nEnterprises are becoming more digital. There is a strong convergence of human and machine intelligence thanks\\nto drivers like advanced sensors and machine learning. Operations and technology are converging.\\n \\n \\n \\nContracts &\\nDecision Making\\n●\\nLarge multi-year contracts will be renegotiated and broken down into shorter duration contracts and will involve\\nmultiple vendors rather than sole sourcing.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n●\\nThe ability to demonstrate value through Proof of Concepts (POCs) and willingness to offer outcome based\\npricing are becoming critical considerations for decision making, Requests for Proposal (RFP)-driven decisions\\nare increasingly rare.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2\\x0cTable of Contents\\nThe SAP Industry\\nSAP as an ERP and Cloud product has become an industry by itself. The core SAP enterprise offering has been reinforced with cloud-based products\\nthat make the entire SAP ecosystem extremely attractive from our perspective due to the following attributes:\\n●\\nThe alignment of SAP to enterprises is extremely strong.  Given the reliance of enterprises on applications, clients tend to make long-term\\nbets on SAP as an enterprise solution.\\n●\\nAccording to the September 2014 “HfS Blueprint Report” from by HfS Research Ltd., the SAP market is a multi-billion-dollar market that\\nis very fragmented (there are over 5,000 consulting firms), with the three largest service providers capturing an increasing share of the\\nmarket.\\n●\\nA significant number of SAP customers must move to S/4 HANA by 2025).\\nOur Approach\\nOur solutions deliver significant business efficiency outcomes through turnkey projects, consulting and offshore services. We have adopted a\\n“strategic acquisition model”, pursuant to which we acquire companies that support our goals. These businesses are realigned as parts of a viable and\\nprofitable operating model. We believe that our strategic service portfolio, deep industry experience and strong global talent pool offer a compelling\\nproposition to clients. In 2017 we acquired ATCG Technology Solutions, Inc., which has become our wholly-owned subsidiary Ameri California.  In 2016,\\nwe acquired three companies: Virtuoso, L.L.C. and DC&M Partners, L.L.C.in the U.S. (now Virtuoso and Ameri Arizona, respectively) and Bigtech in India.\\nThese strategic acquisitions have brought offshore delivery, SAP S/4 HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Hybris and high-end SAP consulting capabilities to\\nour service portfolio.\\nOur Portfolio of Service Offerings\\nOur portfolio of service offerings expanded significantly in 2016 and 2017 with our acquisitions of Ameri Georgia, Ameri Arizona, Ameri\\nCalifornia, Virtuoso and Bigtech. We expect our future service offerings to evolve as we continue to pursue our acquisitive growth strategy.\\nOur current portfolio of services is divided into three categories:\\n \\nCloud Services\\n \\nAn increasing trend in the IT services market is the adoption of cloud services. Historically, clients have resorted to on-premise software solutions,\\nwhich required capital investments in infrastructure and data centers. Cloud services enable clients to build and host their applications at much lower costs. \\nOur services offerings leverage the low cost and flexibility of cloud computing.\\n3\\x0cTable of Contents\\nWe have expertise in deploying SAP’s public, private and hybrid cloud services, as well as SAP S/4 HANA, SAP SuccessFactors and SAP\\nHybris cloud migration services. Our teams are experienced in the rapid delivery of cloud services. We perform SAP application and cloud support and SAP\\ncloud development. Additionally, we provide cloud automation solutions that focus on business objectives and organizational growth.\\n \\nDigital Services\\n \\nWe have developed several cutting-edge mobile solutions, including Simple Advance Planning and Optimization (“APO”), the SAP IBP/S&OP\\nMobile Analytics App and the Langer Index. The Simple APO mobile application (app) provides sales professionals with real-time collaboration capabilities\\nand customer data, on their mobile devices. It increases the efficiency of the sales process and the accuracy of customer needs forecasting. The SAP IBP\\nmobile app enables the real-time management and analysis of sales and operations planning (S&OP) related data from mobile devices. SAP is an\\nimplementation partner for this app. SAP has recognized the app’s value to the ecosystem, as S&OP apps are complex and difficult to design. The Langer\\nIndex is a mobile-supported, web-based assessment system for collecting and analyzing IT organizational effectiveness.\\n \\nWe are also active in robotic process automation (“RPA”), which leverages the capability of artificially intelligent software agents for business\\nprocess automation.  We have expertise in automating disparate and redundant data entry tasks by configuring software robots that seamlessly integrate with\\nexisting software systems. We also provide RPA solutions for reporting and analysis and deliver insights into business functions by translating large data into\\nstructured reports. Lastly, we have a working partnership with Blue Prism, a leading RPA solutions provider, which makes it possible for us to automate up to\\none-third of all standard back-office operations.\\n \\nEnterprise Services\\n \\nWe design, implement and manage Business Intelligence (“BI”) and analytics solutions. BI helps our clients navigate the market better by identifying\\nnew trends and by targeting top-selling products. We also enable clients to use BI for generating instant financial reports and analytics of customer, product\\nand cost information over time.  In addition, we provide solutions for metadata repository, master data management and data quality. Finally, we determine BI\\ndemands across various platforms.\\n \\nOther key enterprise services that we offer include consulting services for global and regional SAP implementations, SAP/IT solution advisory and\\narchitectural services, project management services, IT/ERP strategy and vendor selection services.  Often clients have relied on us to deliver services in non-\\nSAP packages, as well.\\n \\nOur Growth Strategy\\nOur growth strategy is based on customer-driven business expansion and strategic acquisitions of SAP services companies. We introduce specific\\nkey account management strategies to grow organically by cross selling and upselling different services across business units. It is our goal to be a leader in\\nthe SAP cloud, digital and enterprise services market. We use strategic acquisitions, alliances and partnerships to achieve this goal.\\nWe have complementary near-term and longer-term strategies. In the short-term, we continue to focus on high-end consulting and solutions in the\\nSAP ecosystem. Our medium-term focus will be to make an entry into cloud engagements and SAP HANA. Signing up with NEC America as a strategic\\npartner for the SAP HANA migration will be critical to achieving this objective. Additionally, we plan to gain market share in high-growth areas within the\\nSAP ecosystem such as Hybris, SuccessFactors and BI/BW/SAP S/4 HANA. In the long-term, we plan to identify and acquire firms in the areas of Artificial\\nIntelligence (AI) and robotics to bolster our AIR (AI + Internet of things + robotics) practice. We believe that during each phase of our growth strategy\\nbusiness and market conditions will require our plans to evolve or change, and we plan to be agile in addressing both opportunities and exigencies.\\nThe integration of each of our acquisitions into our business enterprise requires establishing our company’s standard operating procedures at each\\nacquired entity, seamlessly transitioning each acquired entity’s branding to the “Ameri100” brand and assessing any necessity to transition account\\nmanagement. The integration process also requires us to evaluate any product-line expansions made possible by the acquired entity and how to bring new\\nproduct lines to the broader customer base of the entire Company. With the integration of each acquisition, we face challenges of maintaining cross-company\\nvisibility and cooperation, creating a cohesive corporate culture, handling unexpected customer reactions and changes and aligning the interests of the\\nacquired entity’s leadership with the interests of the Company. To date, these challenges have been manageable, and we are becoming more adept at managing\\nintegration issues with each new acquisition.\\n \\n4\\x0cTable of Contents\\nSales and Marketing\\n \\nWe combine traditional sales with our strength in industries and technology. Our sales function is composed of direct sales and inside sales\\nprofessionals. Both work closely with our solutions directors to identify potential opportunities within each account. We currently have over 100+ active\\nclients. Using a consultative selling methodology (working with clients to prescribe a solution that suits their need in terms of efficiency, cost and timelines),\\ntarget prospects are identified and a pursuit plan is developed for each key account. We utilize a blended sales model that combines consultative selling with\\ntraditional sales methods. Once the customer has engaged us, the sales, solutions and marketing teams monitor and manage the relationship with the help of\\ncustomer relationship management software.\\n \\nOur marketing strategy is to build a strong, sustainable brand image for our company, position us in the SAP arena and facilitate business\\nopportunities. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, including\\nwebinars, targeted email campaigns, co-sponsoring customer events with SAP to create customer and prospect awareness, search engine marketing and\\nadvertising to drive traffic to our web properties, and website development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through white papers, case\\n studies and marketing collateral.\\nRevenues and Customers\\n \\nWe generate revenue primarily through consulting services performed in the fulfillment of written service contracts. The service contracts we enter\\ninto generally fall into two categories: (1) time-and-materials contracts and (2) fixed-price contracts.\\nWhen a customer enters into a time-and-materials or fixed-price, (or a periodic retainer-based) contract, we recognize revenue in accordance with an\\nevaluation of the deliverables in each contract. If the deliverables represent separate units of accounting, we then measure and allocate the consideration from\\nthe arrangement to the separate units, based on vendor-specific objective evidence of the value for each deliverable.\\nThe revenue under time-and-materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates. Revenue\\npursuant to fixed-price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting. We routinely evaluate whether revenue and\\nprofitability should be recognized in the current period. We estimate the proportional performance on our fixed-price contracts on a monthly basis utilizing\\nhours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project.\\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, sales to five major customers accounted for approximately 43% and 53%\\nof our total revenue, respectively.\\nTechnology Research and Development\\n \\nWe regard our services and solutions and related software products as proprietary. We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark and\\ntrade secret laws of general applicability, employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, distribution and software protection agreements and\\nother intellectual property protection methods to safeguard our technology and software products. We have not applied for patents on any of our technology.\\nWe also rely upon our efforts to design and produce new applications and upon improvements to existing software products to maintain a competitive position\\nin the marketplace.\\n \\nWe did not make any material expenditures on research or development activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and December\\n31, 2016.\\nStrategic Alliances\\n \\nThrough our Lean Enterprise Architecture Partnership (“LEAP”) methodology, we have strategic alliances with technology specialists who perform\\nservices on an as-needed basis for clients. We partner with niche specialty firms globally to obtain specialized resources to meet client needs. Our business\\npartners include executive recruiters, staffing firms and niche technology companies. The terms of each strategic alliance arrangement depend on the nature of\\nthe particular partnership. Such alliance arrangements typically set forth deliverables, scope of the services to be delivered, costs of services and terms and\\nconditions of payment (generally 45 to 90 days for payment to be made). Each alliance arrangement also typically includes terms for indemnification of our\\ncompany, non-solicitation of each partner’s employees by the other partner and dispute resolution by arbitration.\\n \\nAlliances and partnerships broaden our offerings and make us a one-stop solution for clients. Our team constantly produces services that complement\\nour portfolio and build strategic partnerships. Our partner companies range from digital marketing strategy consulting firms to large infrastructure players.\\n \\n5\\x0cTable of Contents\\nOn any given project we evaluate a client’s needs and make our best effort to meet them with our full-time specialists. However, in certain\\ncircumstances, we may need to go outside the Company, and in this case we approach our strategic partners to tap into their pools of technology specialists.\\nProject teams are usually composed of a mix of our full time employees and outside technology specialists. Occasionally, a project team may consist of a\\nCompany manager and a few outside technology specialists. While final accountability for any of our projects rests with the Company, the outside technology\\nspecialists are incentivized to successfully complete a project with project completion payments that are in addition to hourly billing rates we pay the outside\\ntechnology specialists.\\nCompetition\\nThe large number of competitors and the speed of technology change make IT services and outsourcing a challenging business. Competitors in this\\nmarket include systems integration firms, contract programming companies, application software companies, traditional large consulting firms, professional\\nservices groups of computer equipment companies and facilities management and outsourcing companies. Examples of our competitors in the IT services\\nindustry include Accenture, Cartesian Inc., Cognizant, Hexaware Technologies Limited, Infosys Technologies Limited, Mindtree Limited, RCM Technologies\\nInc., Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Virtusa, Inc. and Wipro Limited.\\n \\nWe believe that the principal factors for success in the IT services and outsourcing market include performance and reliability; quality of technical\\nsupport, training and services; responsiveness to customer needs; reputation and experience; financial stability and strong corporate governance; and\\ncompetitive pricing.\\n \\nSome of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and/or greater name recognition, but we believe we\\nare well positioned to capitalize on the following competitive strengths to achieve future growth:\\n·\\nwell-developed recruiting, training and retention model;\\n·\\nsuccessful service delivery model;\\n·\\nbroad referral base;\\n·\\ncontinual investment in process improvement and knowledge capture;\\n·\\ninvestment in research and development;\\n·\\nstrong corporate governance; and\\n·\\ncustom strategic partnerships to provide breadth and depth of services.\\nEmployees\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2017, our total headcount was 417, which includes employees and billable subcontractors. We routinely supplement our billable\\nemployee staff with billable subcontractors, which totaled 153 at December 31, 2017.  Our employees are not part of a collective bargaining arrangement and\\nwe believe our relations with our employees are good. We do not have any material employment agreement with our executive officers.\\nRecent Events and Acquisitions\\nPublic Offering and Uplisting of Common Stock to Nasdaq\\nOn November 21, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,475,000 shares of our common stock, at a price of $4.115 per share, and\\nwarrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,475,000 shares of our common stock, at a price of $0.01 per warrant.

Virtuoso is an SAP consulting firm specialized in providing services\\non SAP S/4 HANA finance, enterprise mobility and cloud migration and is based in Leawood, Kansas. In connection with the merger, Virtuoso’s name was\\nchanged to Ameri100 Virtuoso Inc. The Virtuoso acquisition did not constitute a significant acquisition for the Company for purposes of Regulation S-X.\\nThe total purchase price paid to the Sole Member for the acquisition of Virtuoso was $1,831,881, consisting of:\\n(a)\\nA cash payment in the amount of $675,000 which was due within 90 days of closing and was paid on October 21, 2016;\\n(b)\\n101,250 shares of our common stock at closing, valued at approximately $700,000 based on the $6.51 closing price of our common stock\\non the closing date of the acquisition; and\\n(c)\\nEarn-out payments in cash and stock of $450,000 and approximately $560,807, respectively, to be paid, if earned, through the achievement\\nof annual revenue and gross margin targets in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Out of the total contingent consideration of approximately $1,000,000,\\nwe only considered 50% of the earn-out in the purchase price, mainly due to the reorganization of Virtuoso.\\nAs of January 23, 2018, we had resolved all remaining payments under the Virtuoso merger agreement with the former sole-member of Virtuoso and\\nwe have no further payment obligations pursuant thereto.\\nAcquisition of Bigtech Software Private Limited\\nOn June 23, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Bigtech Software Private Limited, a pure-play SAP services company\\nproviding a wide range of SAP services including turnkey implementations, application management, training and basis ABAP support. Based in Bangalore,\\nIndia, Bigtech offers SAP services to improve business operations at companies of all sizes and verticals. The acquisition of Bigtech was effective as of July\\n1, 2016, and the total consideration for the acquisition of Bigtech was $850,000, consisting of:\\n(a)\\nA cash payment in the amount of $340,000 which was due within 90 days of closing and was paid on September 22, 2016;\\n(b)\\nWarrants for the purchase of 51,000 shares of our common stock (valued at approximately $250,000 based on the $6.51 closing price of our\\ncommon stock on the closing date of the acquisition), with such warrants exercisable for two years; and\\n(c)\\n$255,000, which may become payable in cash earn-outs to the sellers of Bigtech, if Bigtech achieves certain pre-determined revenue and\\nEBITDA targets in 2017 and 2018. We estimate the earn-out payments to be earned at 100% of the targets set forth in the purchase\\nagreement.\\nBigtech’s financial results are included in our condensed consolidated financial results starting July 1, 2016.  The Bigtech acquisition did not\\nconstitute a significant acquisition for the Company for purposes of Regulation S-X. The valuation of Bigtech was made on the basis of its projected\\nrevenues.\\nAcquisition of Ameri Georgia\\nOn November 20, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Bellsoft, Inc., a consulting company based in Lawrenceville, Georgia with over 175\\nconsultants specialized in the areas of SAP software, business intelligence, data warehousing and other enterprise resource planning services. Following the\\nacquisition, the name of Bellsoft, Inc. was changed to Ameri100 Georgia Inc. (“Ameri Georgia”). Ameri Georgia has operations in the United States, Canada\\nand India. For financial accounting purposes, we recognized September 1, 2015 as the effective date of the acquisition. The total consideration for the\\nacquisition of Ameri Georgia was $9,910,817, consisting of:\\n(a)\\nA cash payment in the amount of $3,000,000, which was paid at closing;\\n(b)\\n235,295 shares of our common stock issued at closing, valued at approximately $1,000,000 based on the closing price of our common stock\\non the closing date of the acquisition;\\n \\n8\\x0cTable of Contents\\n(c)\\n$250,000 quarterly cash payments to be paid on the last day of each calendar quarter of 2016;\\n(d)\\nA $1,000,000 cash reimbursement to be paid 5 days following closing to compensate Ameri Georgia for a portion of its approximate cash\\nbalance as of September 1, 2015;\\n(e)\\nApproximately $2,910,817 paid within 30 days of closing in connection with the excess of Ameri Georgia’s accounts receivable over its\\naccounts payable as of September 1, 2015; and\\n(f)\\nEarn-out payments of approximately $500,000 a year for 2016 and 2017, if earned through the achievement of annual revenue and EBITDA\\ntargets specified in the purchase agreement, subject to downward or upward adjustment depending on actual results.\\nOn January 17, 2018, we completed all payment obligations to the former shareholders of Ameri Georgia in connection with the Ameri Georgia\\nshare purchase agreement, and we have no further payment obligations pursuant thereto.\\nAvailable Information\\nOur executive office is located at 100 Canal Pointe Boulevard, Suite 108, Princeton, NJ 08540.

RISK FACTORS\\nIn addition to the information set forth at the beginning of Management’s Discussion and Analysis entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-\\nLooking Information”, investors should consider that there are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our\\ngoals.  If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially and adversely affected.  In such case,\\n the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\\nWe recorded a net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and there can be no assurance that our future operations\\nwill result in net income.\\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, we had net revenue of $48.6 million and $36.2 million, respectively, and\\nwe had comprehensive net loss of $11.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017, we had stockholders’ equity of approximately $19\\nmillion. There can be no assurance that our future operations will result in net income. Our failure to increase our revenues or improve our gross margins will\\nharm our business. We may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If our revenues grow more slowly than\\nwe anticipate, our gross margins fail to improve or our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our operating results will suffer. The fee we charge for\\nour solutions and services may decrease, which would reduce our revenues and harm our business. If we are unable to sell our solutions at acceptable prices\\nrelative to our costs, or if we fail to develop and introduce new solutions on a timely basis and services from which we can derive additional revenues, our\\nfinancial results will suffer.\\n \\n9\\x0cTable of Contents\\nWe and our subsidiaries have limited operating histories and therefore we cannot ensure the long-term successful operation of our business or the\\nexecution of our business plan.\\nOur prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by growing companies in new and rapidly\\nevolving markets, such as the technology consulting markets in which we operate. We must meet many challenges including:\\n·\\nestablishing and maintaining broad market acceptance of our solutions and services and converting that acceptance into direct and indirect\\nsources of revenue;\\n·\\nestablishing and maintaining adoption of our technology solutions in a wide variety of industries and on multiple enterprise architectures;\\n·\\ntimely and successfully developing new solutions and services and increasing the functionality and features of existing solutions and services;\\n·\\ndeveloping solutions and services that result in high degree of enterprise client satisfaction and high levels of end-customer usage;\\n·\\nsuccessfully responding to competition, including competition from emerging technologies and solutions;\\n·\\ndeveloping and maintaining strategic relationships to enhance the distribution, features, content and utility of our solutions and services; and\\n·\\nidentifying, attracting and retaining talented personnel at reasonable market compensation rates in the markets in which we employ.\\nOur business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may be unable to address the risks we face in a cost-effective manner, if at all. If we are unable to\\nsuccessfully address these risks our business will be harmed.\\nWe face working capital constraints and may not have sufficient working capital in the long term and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain\\nadditional financing, which could negatively impact our business.\\n \\nWe have incurred significant and recurring operational losses as a result of our ongoing acquisition strategy. We have outstanding cash payment\\nobligations related to our past acquisitions of approximately $4.3 million.  In addition, under the terms of our Series A Preferred Stock, we are currently\\nobligated to pay approximately $2 million in cash dividends per year on such stock through fiscal year 2019. If our current cash position does not improve\\nsignificantly, we will not have sufficient cash on hand to meet these obligations.  Due to our working capital constraints, we are not current in all payments to\\nall our unsecured noteholders. We are working with certain of our unsecured noteholders to negotiate payment terms until we are able to raise more capital.\\n \\nOperational streamlining that was completed in 2017 is anticipated to provide cash savings of approximately $1.75 million per year. We believe\\nadditional cost-cutting efforts will further reduce cash used in operations.  In addition, we believe that we can obtain additional external financing to meet\\nfuture cash requirements. We raised $1.25 million in March 2017 through the sale of convertible notes and over $6.7 million in gross proceeds through our\\npublic offering of common stock and warrants in November 2017.\\n \\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional sources of capital or that cost savings will provide sufficient working capital.  If\\nwe continue to be unable to pay all outstanding payments under our unsecured notes, the unpaid noteholders may take legal action against us, they may\\naccelerate the payment of the principal under the applicable notes, and our senior secured lender may call a cross-default under our existing credit facility,\\nwhich could result in the acceleration of the obligations thereunder and have a negative impact on our revenue and financial results.  Should we be unable to\\nraise sufficient debt or equity capital, we could be forced to cease operations. Our plan regarding these matters is to work to raise additional debt and/or\\nequity financing to allow us the ability to cover our current cash flow requirements and meet our obligations as they become due. There can be no assurances\\nthat financing will be available or if available, that such financing will be available under favorable terms.\\n \\n10\\x0cTable of Contents\\nThe economic environment, pricing pressures, and decreased employee utilization rates could negatively impact our revenues and operating results.\\nSpending on technology products and services is subject to fluctuations depending on many factors, including the economic environment in the\\nmarkets in which our clients operate.\\nReduced ERP spending in response to a challenging economic environment leads to increased pricing pressure from our clients, which may\\nadversely impact our revenue, gross profits, operating margins and results of operations.\\nIn addition to the business challenges and margin pressure resulting from economic slowdown in the markets in which our clients operate and the\\nresponse of our clients to such slowdown, there is also a growing trend among consumers of ERP services towards consolidation of technology service\\nproviders in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Our success in the competitive bidding process for new projects or in retaining existing projects is\\ndependent on our ability to fulfil client expectations relating to staffing, delivery of services and more stringent service levels. If we fail to meet a client’s\\nexpectations in such projects, this would likely adversely impact our business, revenues and operating margins. In addition, even if we are successful in\\nwinning the mandates for such projects, we may experience significant pressure on our operating margins as a result of the competitive bidding process.\\nMoreover, our ability to maintain or increase pricing is restricted as clients often expect that as we do more business with them, they will receive\\nvolume discounts or lower rates. In addition, existing and new customers are also increasingly using third-party consultants with broad market knowledge to\\nassist them in negotiating contractual terms. Any inability to maintain or increase pricing on account of this practice may also adversely impact our revenues,\\ngross profits, operating margins and results of operations.\\nUncertain global SAP consulting market conditions may continue to adversely affect demand for our services.\\nWe rely heavily on global demand for ERP services, especially SAP consulting by customers. Any weakness for these ERP services by global\\ncustomers will adversely affect our revenue projections and hence our profits. SAP AG is adapting itself to the changes in the market especially towards cloud\\nofferings. These changes may lead to SAP losing its market share to other competitors like Oracle, Microsoft, Salesforce and Workday among many other\\nnewer players. With these setbacks to SAP, we may face uncertain future due to dramatic changes in the market place which in turn will affect our revenues\\nand profits.\\nOur success depends largely upon our highly-skilled technology professionals and our ability to hire, attract, motivate, retain and train these personnel.\\nOur ability to execute projects, maintain our client relationships and acquire new clients depends largely on our ability to attract, hire, train, motivate\\nand retain highly skilled technology professionals, particularly project managers and other mid-level professionals. If we cannot hire, motivate and retain\\npersonnel, our ability to bid for projects, obtain new projects and expand our business will be impaired and our revenues could decline.\\nIncreasing worldwide competition for skilled technology professionals and increased hiring by technology companies may affect our ability to hire\\nand retain an adequate number of skilled and experienced technology professionals, which may in turn have an adverse effect on our business, results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\nIn addition, the demands of changes in technology, evolving standards and changing client preferences may require us to redeploy and retrain our\\ntechnology professionals. If we are unable to redeploy and retrain our technology professionals to keep pace with continuing changes in technology, evolving\\nstandards and changing client preferences, this may adversely affect our ability to bid for and obtain new projects and may have a material adverse effect on\\nour business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nOur strategy to increase our growth through acquisitions may be unsuccessful and could adversely affect our business and results.\\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to further acquire other businesses; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to identify\\nappropriate acquisition targets, successfully acquire identified targets or successfully integrate the business of acquired companies to realize the full benefits\\nof the combined businesses.\\nWhile we recently acquired Ameri California, Ameri Arizona, Virtuoso and Bigtech in connection with our growth strategy to acquire other\\nbusinesses, we can provide no assurance that we will identify appropriate acquisition targets, successfully complete any future acquisitions or successfully\\nintegrate the business of companies we do acquire. Even if we successfully acquire a business entity, there is no assurance that our combined business will\\nbecome profitable. The process of completing the integration of acquired businesses could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of\\nour company and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the pursuit\\nof business acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses, and the incurrence of significant, acquisition related costs in connection with proposed and\\ncompleted acquisitions, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\\n \\n11\\x0cTable of Contents\\nWe face intense competition from other service providers.\\nWe are subject to intense competition in the industry in which we operate which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition\\nand cash flows. We operate in a highly competitive industry, which is served by numerous global, national, regional and local firms. Our industry has\\nexperienced rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards and customer requirements. The principal competitive factors in the IT markets\\ninclude the range of services offered, size and scale of service provider, global reach, technical expertise, responsiveness to client needs, speed in delivery of\\nIT solutions, quality of service and perceived value. Many companies also choose to perform some or all of their back-office IT and IT-enabled operations\\ninternally. Such competitiveness requires us to keep pace with technological developments and maintains leadership; enhance our service offerings, including\\nthe breadth of our services and portfolio, and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner.\\nWe market our service offerings to large and medium-sized organizations. Generally, the pricing for the projects depends on the type of contract,\\nwhich includes time and material contracts, annual maintenance contracts (fixed time frame), fixed price contracts and transaction price based contracts. The\\nintense competition and the changes in the general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer\\ndeep discounts on certain services or provide services that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable\\nterms in order to compete successfully. Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause revenues to decline and may reduce margins\\nand could adversely affect results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Some of our competitors may bundle software products and services for\\npromotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time,\\nsignificantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain services. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our\\nservices or changes in customer demand, our revenues and cash flows could decrease.\\nOur competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition and, therefore, may be\\nbetter able to compete for new work and skilled professionals. Similarly, if our competitors are successful in identifying and implementing newer service\\nenhancements in response to rapid changes in technology and customer preferences, they may be more successful at selling their services. If we are unable to\\nrespond to such changes our results of operations may be harmed. Further, a client may choose to use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside\\nfirm to perform the types of services we provide. We cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth in the face of\\ncompetitive pressures, including competition for skilled technology professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an on-site/offshore\\nbusiness model.\\nIn addition, we may face competition from companies that increase in size or scope as the result of strategic alliances such as mergers or\\nacquisitions. These transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers, software companies and vendors and service providers.\\nThe result of any such vertical integration may be greater integration of products and services that were once offered separately by independent vendors. Our\\naccess to such products and services may be reduced as a result of such an industry trend, which could adversely affect our competitive position. These types\\nof events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, such as reducing our revenue, increasing our costs,\\nlowering our gross margin percentage and requiring us to recognize impairments on our assets.\\nOur business could be adversely affected if we do not anticipate and respond to technology advances in our industry and our clients’ industries.\\nThe IT and global outsourcing and SAP consulting services industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards,\\nchanging client preferences and new product introductions. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop IT solutions that keep pace with industry\\ndevelopments. We may not be successful in addressing these developments on a timely basis or at all. In addition, products or technologies developed by\\nothers may not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\\nA significant number of organizations are attempting to migrate business applications to advanced technologies. As a result, our ability to remain\\ncompetitive will be dependent on several factors, including our ability to develop, train and hire employees with skills in advanced technologies, breadth and\\ndepth of process and technology expertise, service quality, knowledge of industry, marketing and sales capabilities. Our failure to hire, train and retain\\nemployees with such skills could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our ability to remain competitive will also be dependent on our ability to\\ndesign and implement, in a timely and cost- effective manner, effective transition strategies for clients moving to advanced architectures. Our failure to design\\nand implement such transition strategies in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\\nfinancial condition and cash flows.\\n \\n12\\x0cTable of Contents\\nOur operations and assets in India expose us to regulatory, economic, political and other uncertainties in India, which could harm our business.\\n \\nWe have an offshore presence in India where a number of our technical professionals are located. In the past, the Indian economy has experienced\\nmany of the problems confronting the economies of developing countries, including high inflation and varying gross domestic product growth. Salaries and\\nother related benefits constitute a major portion of our total operating costs. Many of our employees based in India where our wage costs have historically\\nbeen significantly lower than wage costs in the United States and Europe for comparably skilled professionals, and this has been one of our competitive\\nadvantages. However, wage increases in India or other countries where we have our operations may prevent us from sustaining this competitive advantage if\\nwages increase. We may need to increase the levels of our employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to retain talent. If such events occur, we may\\nbe unable to continue to increase the efficiency and productivity of our employees and wage increases in the long term may reduce our profit margins.\\nOur clients may seek to reduce their dependence on India for outsourced IT services or take advantage of the services provided in countries with labor\\ncosts similar to or lower than India.\\nClients which presently outsource a significant proportion of their IT services requirements to vendors in India may, for various reasons, including in\\nresponse to rising labor costs in India and to diversify geographic risk, seek to reduce their dependence on one country. We expect that future competition will\\nincreasingly include firms with operations in other countries, especially those countries with labor costs similar to or lower than India, such as China, the\\nPhilippines and countries in Eastern Europe. Since wage costs in our industry in India are increasing, our ability to compete effectively will become\\nincreasingly dependent on our reputation, the quality of our services and our expertise in specific industries. If labor costs in India rise at a rate that is\\nsignificantly greater than labor costs in other countries, our reliance on the labor in India may reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our ability to\\ncompete, which would, in turn, have a negative impact on our results of operations.\\nOur business could be materially adversely affected if we do not or are unable to protect our intellectual property or if our services are found to infringe\\nupon or misappropriate the intellectual property of others.\\nOur success depends in part upon certain methodologies and tools we use in designing, developing and implementing applications systems in\\nproviding our services. We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and intellectual property laws to protect confidential\\ninformation and intellectual property rights of ours and our third parties from whom we license intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements\\nwith our employees and limit distribution of proprietary information. The steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of\\nproprietary information and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. At the same time, our\\ncompetitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services. Any significant misappropriation, infringement or\\ndevaluation of such rights could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\\nLitigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any\\nsuch litigation could be time consuming and costly. Although we believe that our services do not infringe or misappropriate on the intellectual property rights\\nof others and that we have all rights necessary to utilize the intellectual property employed in our business, defense against these claims, even if not\\nmeritorious, could be expensive and divert our attention and resources from operating our company. A successful claim of intellectual property infringement\\nagainst us could require us to pay a substantial damage award, develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products or services\\nthat contain the infringing technology. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash\\nflows.\\nAny disruption in the supply of power, IT infrastructure and telecommunications lines to our facilities could disrupt our business process or subject us to\\nadditional costs.\\nAny disruption in basic infrastructure, including the supply of power, could negatively impact our ability to provide timely or adequate services to\\nour clients. We rely on a number of telecommunications service and other infrastructure providers to maintain communications between our various facilities\\nand clients in India, the United States and elsewhere. Telecommunications networks are subject to failures and periods of service disruption, which can\\nadversely affect our ability to maintain active voice and data communications among our facilities and with our clients. Such disruptions may cause harm to\\nour clients’ business. We do not maintain business interruption insurance and may not be covered for any claims or damages if the supply of power, IT\\ninfrastructure or telecommunications lines is disrupted. This could disrupt our business process or subject us to additional costs, materially adversely affecting\\nour business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\\nSystem security risks and cyber-attacks could disrupt our information technology services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce\\nour expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price and the value of our warrants.\\nSecurity and availability of IT infrastructure is of the utmost concern for our business, and the security of critical information and infrastructure\\nnecessary for rendering services is also one of the top priorities of our customers.\\n \\n13\\x0cTable of Contents\\nSystem security risks and cyber-attacks could breach the security and disrupt the availability of our IT services provided to customers. Any such\\nbreach or disruption could allow the misuse of our information systems, resulting in litigation and potential liability for us, the loss of existing or potential\\nclients, damage to our reputation and diminished brand value and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\\nOur network and our deployed security controls could also be penetrated by a skilled computer hacker or intruder. Further, a hacker or intruder could\\ncompromise the confidentiality and integrity of our protected information, including personally identifiable information; deploy malicious software or code\\nlike computer viruses, worms or Trojan horses, etc. may exploit any security vulnerabilities, known or unknown, of our information system; cause disruption\\nin the availability of our information and services; and attack our information system through various other mediums.\\nWe also procure software or hardware products from third party vendors that provide, manage and monitor our services. Such products may contain\\nknown or unfamiliar manufacturing, design or other defects which may allow a security breach or cyber-attack, if exploited by a computer hacker or intruder,\\nor may be capable of disrupting performance of our IT services and prevent us from providing services to our clients.\\nIn addition, we manage, store, process, transmit and have access to significant amounts of data and information that may include our proprietary and\\nconfidential information and that of our clients. This data may include personal information, sensitive personal information, personally identifiable\\ninformation or other critical data and information, of our employees, contractors, officials, directors, end customers of our clients or others, by which any\\nindividual may be identified or likely to be identified. Our data security and privacy systems and procedures meet applicable regulatory standards and\\nundergo periodic compliance audits by independent third parties and customers. However, if our compliance with these standards is inadequate, we may be\\nsubject to regulatory penalties and litigation, resulting in potential liability for us and an adverse impact on our business.\\nWe are still susceptible to data security or privacy breaches, including accidental or deliberate loss and unauthorized disclosure or dissemination of\\nsuch data or information. Any breach of such data or information may lead to identity theft, impersonation, deception, fraud, misappropriation or other\\noffenses in which such information may be used to cause harm to our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, results\\nof operations and cash flows.\\nWe must effectively manage the growth of our operations, or our company will suffer.\\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan requires an effective planning and management process. If funding is available, we intend to\\nincrease the scope of our operations and acquire complimentary businesses. Implementing our business plan will require significant additional funding and\\nresources. If we grow our operations, we will need to hire additional employees and make significant capital investments. If we grow our operations, it will\\nplace a significant strain on our existing management and resources. If we grow, we will need to improve our financial and managerial controls and reporting\\nsystems and procedures, and we will need to expand, train and manage our workforce. Any failure to manage any of the foregoing areas efficiently and\\neffectively would cause our business to suffer.\\nOur revenues are concentrated in a limited number of clients and our revenues may be significantly reduced if these clients decrease their IT spending.\\nOur client contracts are based on time and materials expenses. We do not have long-term client contracts. Our client contracts contain standard\\npayment terms, and our clients only pay us for services rendered. We have limited exposure for non-payment by our clients and do not have any unresolved\\nclient debts. While our client contracts can be terminated with little or no notice, it is uncommon for our clients to terminate an engagement in the middle of\\nthe implementation of services.\\nFor the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, sales to five major customers accounted for approximately 43% of our total\\nrevenue. Consequently, if our top clients reduce or postpone their IT spending significantly, this may lower the demand for our services and negatively affect\\nour revenues and profitability. Further, any significant decrease in the growth of the financial services or other industry segments on which we focus may\\nreduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows.\\nOur client contracts can typically be terminated without cause and with little or no notice or penalty, which could negatively impact our revenues and\\nprofitability.\\nOur clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive, project-by-project basis. Many of our client contracts can be terminated with or without cause. Our\\nbusiness is dependent on the decisions and actions of our clients, and there are a number of factors relating to our clients that are outside of our control which\\nmight lead to termination of a project or the loss of a client, including:\\n \\n14\\x0cTable of Contents\\n·\\nfinancial difficulties for a client;\\n·\\na change in strategic priorities, resulting in a reduced level of technology spending;\\n·\\na demand for price reductions; or an unwillingness to accept higher pricing due to various factors such as higher wage costs, higher cost of\\ndoing business;\\n·\\na change in outsourcing strategy by moving more work to the client’s in-house technology departments or to our competitors;\\n·\\nthe replacement by our clients of existing software with packaged software supported by licensors;\\n·\\nmergers and acquisitions;\\n·\\nconsolidation of technology spending by a client, whether arising out of mergers and acquisitions, or otherwise; and\\n·\\nsudden ramp-downs in projects due to an uncertain economic environment.\\nOur inability to control the termination of client contracts could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur engagements with customers are typically singular in nature and do not necessarily provide for subsequent engagements.\\nOur clients generally retain us on a short-term, engagement-by-engagement basis in connection with specific projects, rather than on a recurring\\nbasis under long-term contracts. Although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from repeat business, which we define as revenues from a\\nclient who also contributed to our revenues during the prior fiscal year, our engagements with our clients are typically for projects that are singular in nature.\\nTherefore, we must seek out new engagements when our current engagements are successfully completed or terminated, and we are constantly seeking to\\nexpand our business with existing clients and secure new clients for our services. In addition, in order to continue expanding our business, we may need to\\nsignificantly expand our sales and marketing group, which would increase our expenses and may not necessarily result in a substantial increase in business. If\\nwe are unable to generate a substantial number of new engagements for projects on a continual basis, our business and results of operations would likely be\\nadversely affected.\\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors\\ninclude the timing and number of client projects commenced and completed during the quarter, the number of working days in a quarter, employee hiring,\\nattrition and utilization rates and the mix of time-and-material projects versus fixed price deliverable projects and maintenance projects during the quarter.\\nAdditionally, periodically our cost increases due to both the hiring of new employees and strategic investments in infrastructure in anticipation of future\\nopportunities for revenue growth.\\nThese and other factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and this makes the prediction of our financial results\\non a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts.\\nWe are heavily dependent on our senior management, and a loss of a member of our senior management team could cause our stock price and the value\\nof our warrants to suffer.\\nIf we lose members of our senior management, we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis, and our business could be\\nadversely affected. Our existing operations and continued future development depend to a significant extent upon the performance and active participation of\\ncertain key individuals. We do not currently maintain key man insurance. If we were to lose any of our key personnel, we may not be able to find appropriate\\nreplacements on a timely basis and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\\n \\n15\\x0cTable of Contents\\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of\\nwhich could adversely affect its operations.\\n \\nWe must comply with all applicable international trade, customs, export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States\\nand other countries. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to\\nforeign governments or officials. Changes in trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned\\ncountries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violation of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions\\nor fines and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\\nOur income tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities, and the final determination of our tax liability with respect to tax audits and any\\nrelated litigation could adversely affect our financial results.\\nAlthough we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare and submit our tax filings on a timely basis and in accordance with all\\napplicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from\\nour historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the\\nperiods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties and/or\\ninterest assessments.\\nFailure of our customers to pay the amounts owed to us in a timely manner may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\\nWe generally provide payment terms ranging from 30 to 60 days. As a result, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our\\ncustomers, representing approximately 60% of current assets as of December 31, 2017 and approximately 80% of current assets as of December 31, 2016.\\nAccounts receivable from sales to customers were $8.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and $8.1 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31,\\n2017, the largest amount owed by a single customer was approximately 12% of total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2017, we had no allowance for\\ndoubtful accounts. If any of our significant customers have insufficient liquidity, we could encounter significant delays or defaults in payments owed to us by\\nsuch customers, and we may need to extend our payment terms or restructure the receivables owed to us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our\\nfinancial condition. Any deterioration in the financial condition of our customers will increase the risk of uncollectible receivables. Global economic\\nuncertainty could also affect our customers’ ability to pay our receivables in a timely manner or at all or result in customers going into bankruptcy or\\nreorganization proceedings, which could also affect our ability to collect our receivables.\\nIf we are unable to collect our dues or receivables from or invoice our unbilled services to our clients, our results of operations and cash flows could be\\nadversely affected.\\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payments from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed. We evaluate\\nthe financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. Macroeconomic conditions, such as a potential credit crisis in the\\nglobal financial system, could result in financial difficulties for our clients, including limited access to the credit markets, insolvency or bankruptcy. Such\\nconditions could cause clients to delay payment, request modifications of their payment terms, or default on their payment obligations to us, all of which\\ncould increase our receivables. If we experience delays in the collection of, or are unable to collect, our client balances, our results of operations and cash\\nflows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience delays in billing and collection for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.\\nGoodwill that we carry on our balance sheet could give rise to significant impairment charges in the future.\\nGoodwill is subject to impairment review at least annually. Impairment testing under standards as issued by the Financial Accounting Standards\\nBoard may lead to impairment charges in the future. Any significant impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\\nOur revenue and operating results may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology\\nspending by our clients.\\nOur business depends, in part, upon continued reliance on the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients as well as their\\ncustomers and suppliers. In particular, the success of our new service offerings requires continued demand for such services and our ability to meet this\\ndemand in a cost-effective manner. In challenging economic environments, our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to\\nfocus on other priorities and prospective clients may decide not to engage our services. Also, many companies have already invested substantial resources in\\ntheir current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information, and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt\\nexisting personnel, processes and infrastructures. If the growth of technology usage in business, or our clients’ spending on such technology, declines, or if we\\ncannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technological solutions, our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected.\\n \\n16\\x0cTable of Contents\\nOur business will suffer if we fail to anticipate and develop new services and enhance existing services in order to keep pace with rapid changes in\\ntechnology and the industries on which we focus.\\nThe ERP services market is characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changing client preferences and new product\\nand service introductions. Our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate these advances and enhance our existing offerings or develop new\\nproduct and service offerings to meet client needs. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these advances on a timely basis, or, if we do\\nrespond, the services or technologies we develop may not be successful in the marketplace. We may also be unsuccessful in stimulating customer demand for\\nnew and upgraded products, or seamlessly managing new product introductions or transitions. Further, products, services or technologies that are developed\\nby our competitors may render our services non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address the demands of the rapidly evolving information technology\\nenvironment, particularly with respect to digital technology, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and storage, mobility and\\napplications and analytics, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of\\noperations.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments, including non-U.S. governments. In particular, we are\\nrequired to comply with certain Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of,\\napplicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also\\nchange from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure\\nto comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\\nOur international operations subject us to exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\\nWe have operations in three countries and as we expand our international operations, more of our customers pay us in foreign currencies.\\nTransactions in currencies other than U.S. dollars subject us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the\\nU.S. dollar and other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income, which may in turn have a negative impact on our\\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies has changed substantially\\nin recent years and may fluctuate in the future. We expect that the vast majority of our revenues will continue to be generated in U.S. dollars for the\\nforeseeable future and that a significant portion of our expenses, including personnel costs, as well as capital and operating expenditures, will continue to be\\ndenominated in other currencies such as Indian Rupee. The hedging strategies that we may implement in the future to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate\\nrisks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market, operational\\nand counterparty credit risks. Accordingly, we may incur losses from our use of foreign exchange derivate contracts that could have a material adverse effect\\non our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nAcquisitions, expansions or infrastructure investments may require us to increase our level of indebtedness or issue additional equity.\\nAs we continue to consummate additional acquisition opportunities, undertake additional expansion activities or make substantial investments in our\\ninfrastructure, our capital needs continue to expand. Accordingly, we may need to draw down additional borrowings under our credit facility or access public\\nor private debt or equity markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in raising additional debt or equity, or that we will be able to\\nraise such funds on terms that we would consider acceptable.\\nAn increase in the level of indebtedness, if any, could, among other things:\\n·\\nmake it difficult for us to obtain financing in the future for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other\\npurposes;\\n·\\nlimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business;\\n·\\nlimit our ability to pay dividends;\\n·\\nmake us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and\\n·\\naffect certain financial covenants with which we must comply in connection with our credit facilities.\\nAdditionally, any further equity offering would dilute your ownership interest in our company.\\n \\n17\\x0cTable of Contents\\nOur earnings and financial condition may be negatively impacted by certain tax related matters.\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could\\nbe adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher\\nthan anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in accounting principles or\\ninterpretations and changes in tax laws. Certain jurisdictions, including the United States, are actively contemplating tax reform and tax policy changes. Any\\nof these changes could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In addition, our income tax returns are subject to\\nexamination in the jurisdictions in which we operate. An unfavorable outcome of one or more of these examinations may have an adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\\nInternational hostilities, terrorist activities, other violence or war, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions, could delay or reduce the\\nnumber of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers, thereby adversely affecting our business, results of operations\\nand financial condition.\\nHostilities involving acts of terrorism, violence or war, natural disasters, global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for\\nthese events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our customers. Such events may cause customers to delay\\ntheir decisions on spending for information technology, consulting, and business process services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and\\nglobal economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our personnel and to our and our customers’ physical facilities and\\noperations around the world. Additionally, by disrupting communications and travel, giving rise to travel restrictions, and increasing the difficulty of\\nobtaining and retaining highly-skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our\\ncustomers. The majority of our employees are located in India, and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the United States and Canada are Indian\\nnationals who are able to work in the United States and Europe only because they hold current visas and work permits. Any inability to travel could cause us\\nto incur additional unexpected costs and expenses or could impair our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations. In addition, any\\nextended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers.\\nHostilities involving the United States, Canada and India where we provide services to our customers, and other acts of terrorism, violence or war,\\nnatural disasters, global health risks or pandemics may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues. If we fail to defend against any\\nof these occurrences, we might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems. If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our customers,\\nour business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\\nAnti-outsourcing legislation, if adopted, and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could impair our ability to service our customers\\nand adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in the United States, which\\nis our largest market. For example, a number of measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by U.S. companies have been put forward for\\nconsideration by the U.S. Congress and in various state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the\\nloss of jobs domestically. Further, the current U.S. administration or Congress may seek to limit outsourcing by U.S. companies. If enacted, such measures\\nmay broaden existing restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services\\ndirectly or indirectly, or impact private industry with measures that include tax disincentives, fees or penalties, intellectual property transfer restrictions,\\nmandatory government audit requirements, and new standards that have the effect of restricting the use of certain business and/or work visas. In the event that\\nany of these measures become law, our ability to provide services to our customers could be impaired, which could adversely affect our business, results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\nIn addition, from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing, such as domestic job loss\\nand theft and misappropriation of sensitive customer data, particularly involving service providers in India. Current or prospective customers may elect to\\nperform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers due to negative perceptions that may be associated\\nwith using global service delivery models or firms. Any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm\\nour ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our customers operate.\\n \\n18\\x0cTable of Contents\\nRestrictions on immigration may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to customers, which could hamper our growth and cause our\\nrevenues to decline.\\n \\nOur future success continues to depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills, including those\\nfrom developing countries, especially India. The ability of foreign nationals to work in the United States, depends on their and our ability to obtain the\\nnecessary visas and work permits for our personnel who need to travel internationally. If we are unable to obtain such visas or work permits, or if their\\nissuance is delayed or if their length is shortened, we may not be able to provide services to our customers or to continue to provide services on a timely and\\ncost-effective basis, receive revenues as early as expected or manage our delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could, any of which could have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nImmigration and work permit laws and regulations in the countries in which we have customers are subject to legislative and administrative changes\\nas well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement. For example, the U.S. Congress has been actively considering various proposals that\\nwould make extensive changes to U.S. immigration laws regarding the admission of high-skilled temporary and permanent workers. Further, the current U.S.\\nadministration or Congress may seek to limit the admission of high-skilled temporary and permanent workers and has issued and may continue to issue\\nexecutive orders designed to limit immigration. Any such provisions may increase our cost of doing business in the United States and may discourage\\ncustomers from seeking our services. Our international expansion strategy and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially\\nadversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair\\nour ability to staff projects with professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed.\\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Indebtedness\\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial\\ncondition.\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $5.6 million in borrowings outstanding under our $10 million credit facility (the “Credit Facility”),\\nwhich provides for up to $8 million in principal for revolving loans (the “Revolving Loans”) for general working capital purposes, up to $2 million in\\nprincipal pursuant to a term loan (the “Term Loan”) for the purpose of a permitted business acquisition and up to $200,000 for letters of credit.\\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to our investors, including, but not limited to:\\n·\\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;\\n·\\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our\\nindebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or\\nother general corporate purposes;\\n·\\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and the industry in which we\\noperate;\\n·\\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and\\n·\\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.\\nA breach of a covenant or restriction contained in our senior secured credit facility could result in a default that could in turn permit the affected\\nlender to accelerate the repayment of principal and accrued interest on our outstanding loans and terminate its commitments to lend additional funds. If the\\nlender under such indebtedness accelerates the repayment of our borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those\\nborrowings as well as any other indebtedness.\\nInterest under the Credit Facility is payable monthly in arrears and accrues as follows:\\n(a)\\nin the case of Revolving Loans, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus (ii) 2.00%;\\n(b)\\nin the case of the Term Loan, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus (ii) 3.75%; and\\n(c)\\nin the case of other obligations under the Credit Facility, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (A) 3.25% or (B) Wall Street\\nJournal Prime Rate plus (ii) 3.75%.\\nThe Credit Facility also requires the payment of certain fees, including, but not limited to letter of credit fees and an unused Revolving Loans fee. An\\nincrease in interest rates would adversely affect our profitability. To the extent that our access to credit is restricted because of our own performance or\\nconditions in the capital markets generally, our financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\\n \\n19\\x0cTable of Contents\\nTo date, we are not in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the loan agreement with Sterling National Bank. We received waivers\\nfrom Sterling National Bank for our non-compliance with the loan agreement for the quarters ended March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and\\nDecember 31, 2017 in exchange for the payment of a fee of $5,000 for each quarterly waiver. We do not expect Sterling National Bank to continue to grant\\nfurther waivers for continued non-compliance. In the event we are not in compliance with the loan agreement in the future and Sterling National Bank were to\\ndiscontinue granting us waivers and call a default on the loan agreement, we would be forced to find another lender to take its place and we would face\\ngreater short-term working capital constraints, which could adversely affect our operations and our financial results.\\nIn addition, we have an outstanding aggregate of $1.25 million in 8% Convertible Unsecured Promissory Notes (the “2017 Notes”), which were\\nissued to four accredited investors, including one of the Company’s then-directors, Dhruwa N. Rai, and David Luci, who became a director of the Company in\\nFebruary 2018. The 2017 Notes bear interest at 8% per annum until maturity in March 2020, with interest being paid annually on the first, second and third\\nanniversaries of the issuance of the 2017 Notes beginning in March 2018. From and after an event of default and for so long as the event of default is\\ncontinuing, the 2017 Notes will bear default interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The 2017 Notes can be prepaid by us at any time without penalty. As of\\nMarch 29, 2018, we are not current in the payment of interest on all of the 2017 Notes and are in discussion with holders of the 2017 notes for which we are\\nnot current in the payment of interest to negotiate longer payment terms until we are able to raise more capital.\\nThe 2017 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $2.80. The holders of the 2017 Notes have the right,\\nat their option, at any time and from time to time to convert, in part or in whole, the outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest under\\nthe 2017 Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock at the then applicable conversion price.\\nThe 2017 Notes rank junior to our secured credit facility with Sterling National Bank. The 2017 Notes also include certain negative covenants\\nincluding, without the investors’ approval, restrictions on dividends and other restricted payments and reclassification of its stock.\\nOn March 10, 2017, we issued as consideration to the selling stockholders of Ameri California unsecured promissory notes issued for the aggregate\\nprincipal amount of $3,750,000 (which notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum and mature on June 30, 2018).  On February 28, 2018, we entered the\\nAmendment with Moneta Ventures Fund I, L.P. to amend the terms of the Moneta Note. Among other things, the Amendment provided for the extension of\\nthe maturity of the Moneta Note to August 31, 2018, amendment of the payment terms of the Moneta Note, waiver by Moneta of the existence of any\\nCompany event of default pursuant to the Moneta Note as of February 28, 2018 and waiver by the Company of certain restrictions with respect to the resale\\nof certain restricted common stock of the Company held by Moneta.\\nOur level of indebtedness may make it difficult to service our debt and may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing, use operating\\ncash flow in other areas of our business or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\\nOur Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to conduct business.\\nThe Credit Facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, will limit or restrict our ability to:\\nincur additional indebtedness (including guaranty obligations); incur liens; engage in mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions (other than\\npursuant to transactions approved by the lender); sell assets; pay dividends and make other payments in respect of capital stock; make acquisitions,\\ninvestments, loans and advances; pay and modify the terms of certain indebtedness; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into negative pledge\\nclauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions; and change its line of business, in each case, subject to certain limited exceptions. As a result of these\\ncovenants and restrictions, we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or other financing to compete\\neffectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants.\\nFailure to comply with such restrictive covenants may lead to default and acceleration under our Credit Facility and may impair our ability to conduct\\nbusiness. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from\\nthe lenders and/or amend the covenants, which may adversely affect our financial condition.\\n20\\x0cTable of Contents\\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under our Credit Facility, our lender could elect to accelerate payments due and terminate all commitments to\\nextend further credit. Consequently, we may not have sufficient assets to repay the Credit Facility.\\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under our Credit Facility, the lender thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be\\nimmediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lender under the Credit\\nFacility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. The Company has pledged substantially all of its assets as collateral\\nunder the Credit Facility. If the lender accelerates the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay the Credit\\nFacility.\\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our\\ncontrol, including the following:\\n·\\ntechnological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors;\\n·\\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\\n·\\nsales of our common stock, including management shares;\\n·\\nlimited availability of freely-tradable “unrestricted” shares of our common stock to satisfy purchase orders and demand;\\n·\\nour ability to execute our business plan;\\n·\\noperating results that fall below expectations;\\n·\\nloss of any strategic relationship;\\n·\\nindustry developments;\\n·\\neconomic and other external factors;\\n·\\nour ability to manage the costs of maintaining adequate internal financial controls and procedures in connection with the acquisition of\\nadditional businesses; and\\n·\\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating\\nperformance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also significantly affect the market price of our common stock.\\nHolders of our warrants will have no rights as a common stockholder until they exercise their warrants and acquire our common stock.\\nUntil a holder of our warrants acquires shares of our common stock upon exercise of such warrants, such holder will have no rights with respect to\\nshares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. Upon exercise of warrants by, the holder shall become entitled to exercise the rights of a\\ncommon stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.\\nThe warrants may not have any value.\\nEach warrant has an exercise price per share of $4.115, is currently exercisable and expires five years from the date of issuance. In the event the price\\nof our common stock does not exceed the exercise price of the warrants during the period when the warrants are exercisable, the warrants may not have any\\nvalue.\\n \\n21\\x0cTable of Contents\\nA significant number of our shares are eligible for sale and their sale or potential sale may depress the market price of our common stock.\\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. Certain of our\\nstockholders currently hold shares which are subject to restrictive legends that may be eligible for removal, and if such stockholders complete the process for\\nremoval of an applicable restrictive legend, their shares will become freely tradeable.  In addition, over four million shares are issuable upon exercise of\\noptions and warrants, settlement of restricted stock units and conversion of the 2017 Notes. Pursuant to an effective registration statement, 1,000,000 shares\\nissuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants are freely tradeable unless they are purchased by our “affiliates,” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities\\nAct. If any options are exercised, restricted stock units are settled or the 2017 Notes are converted, the shares issued upon such exercise, settlement or\\nconversion (as applicable) will also be restricted, but may be sold under Rule 144 after the shares have been held for six months. Sales under Rule 144 may be\\nsubject to volume limitations and other conditions.\\nIn addition to the possibility that actual sales of significant amounts of our common stock in the public market could harm our common stock price,\\nthe fact that our stockholders have the ability to make such sales could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an “overhang,” in anticipation of which\\nthe market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could also make it more\\ndifficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or\\nappropriate.\\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the future. As a result, any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable\\nfuture. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors as our board\\nof directors may consider relevant. In addition, no dividends will be declared or paid or set apart for payment on our common stock unless all accumulated\\naccrued and unpaid dividends in respect of our Series A Preferred Stock are contemporaneously declared and paid in cash or declared and a sum of cash\\nsufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series A Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods with respect to which full dividends\\nwere not paid on the Series A Preferred Stock in cash. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your\\ninvestment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\\nThe terms of our financing agreements may limit our ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.\\nFinancing agreements, whether ours or those of our subsidiaries and whether in place now or in the future may include restrictions on our ability to\\npay cash dividends on our capital stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock. These limitations may cause us to be unable to pay dividends on the Series A\\nPreferred Stock unless we can refinance amounts outstanding under those agreements. We do not intend to pay cash dividends to the extent we are restricted\\nby any of our financing arrangements.\\nWe currently have Series A Preferred Stock outstanding and our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to create new series of\\npreferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.\\nOur board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our board of directors also has the\\nauthority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. We currently have 405,395 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. The Series\\nA Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation provides for the payment of cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock at a rate of 9.00% per annum,\\nprovided that we may pay dividends in-kind through the issuance of additional shares to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock at a rate per annum equal to\\n11.00% per annum, at the sole option of the Company, for up to four quarterly dividend periods in any consecutive 36-month period, determined on a rolling\\nbasis.  As we paid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in-kind for each quarter of 2017, we are obligated to pay cash dividends no the Series A\\nPreferred Stock in 2018 and 2019. If we do not pay such dividends in cash, it will be a quarterly dividend payment default, and following six such unpaid\\ndefaults, the 11% dividend rate shall apply.  Our Series A Preferred Stock gives its holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to\\nreceive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a\\npremium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of additional series of preferred stock\\nwith such rights preferential to the rights of our common stock, including the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our\\ncommon stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our\\nexisting stockholders.\\n \\n22\\x0cTable of Contents\\nBecause certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring\\nstockholder approval.\\nOur directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, collectively, control the majority of our voting securities.\\nAccordingly, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, will have significant influence on the ability to control\\nthe Company and the outcome of issues submitted to our stockholders.\\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading\\nvolume could decline.\\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our\\nbusiness. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts and you should not invest in our common stock in anticipation that\\nwe will obtain additional analyst coverage. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research\\nabout our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly,\\ndemand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\\nIf the benefits of any proposed acquisition of do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of our\\ncommon stock may decline.\\nIf the benefits of any proposed acquisition of do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our common stock\\nprior to the closing of the proposed acquisition may decline. The market values of our common stock at the time of the proposed acquisition may vary\\nsignificantly from their prices on the date the acquisition target was identified.\\nIn addition, broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance.\\nThe stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of\\nthe particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor\\nconfidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price\\nregardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect\\nour ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance, or their interpretation, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to\\nour previously filed financial statements, which could cause our stock price to decline.\\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various\\nbodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may\\nhave a significant effect on our reported results and retroactively affect previously reported results.\\nBeing a public company results in additional expenses, diverts management’s attention and could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain\\nqualified directors.\\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\\nAct”). These requirements generate significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more difficult, time consuming or\\ncostly and may place significant strain on our personnel and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to establish the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\\nover financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight are required.\\nAs a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have an adverse and even material effect on our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. These rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and\\nofficer liability insurance. If we are unable to obtain appropriate director and officer insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors,\\nespecially those directors who may be deemed independent, could be adversely impacted.\\nIf our shares of common stock become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity\\nsecurities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain\\nautomated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange\\nor system. If we do not retain our listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be\\ndeemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a\\nstandardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a\\npenny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment\\nfor the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions\\ninvolving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the\\ntrading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\\n \\n23\\x0cTable of Contents\\nThe Series A Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our indebtedness.\\nWe currently have no other capital stock outstanding that is senior to or on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock.  In the event of our bankruptcy,\\nliquidation, reorganization or other winding-up, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series A Preferred Stock only after all of our\\nindebtedness has been paid.  In addition, we are a holding company and the Series A Preferred Stock will effectively rank junior to all existing and future\\nindebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries and any capital stock of our subsidiaries not held by us. The rights of holders\\nof the Series A Preferred Stock to participate in the distribution of assets of our subsidiaries will rank junior to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors\\nand any other equity holders. Consequently, if we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets remaining to pay\\namounts due on any or all of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding. We and our subsidiaries may incur substantial amounts of additional debt and\\nother obligations that will rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock.\\nWe are not obligated to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock if prohibited by law and will not be able to pay cash dividends if we have\\ninsufficient cash to do so.\\nUnder Delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus” or, if there is no “surplus,” from the corporation’s net profits for the\\nthen-current or the preceding fiscal year. Unless we operate profitably, our ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock would require the\\navailability of adequate “surplus,” which is defined as the excess, if any, of our net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital.  Further, even if\\nadequate surplus is available to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay cash dividends on the Series A\\n Preferred Stock.\\nThe terms of our financing agreements may limit our ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.\\nFinancing agreements, whether ours or those of our subsidiaries and whether in place now or in the future may include restrictions on our ability to\\npay cash dividends on our capital stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock. These limitations may cause us to be unable to pay dividends on the Series A\\nPreferred Stock unless we can refinance amounts outstanding under those agreements. We do not intend to pay cash dividends to the extent we are restricted\\nby any of our financing arrangements.\\n \\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is a recent issuance that does not have an established trading market, which may negatively affect its market value and the\\nability to transfer or sell such shares.\\n \\nThe shares of Series A Preferred Stock are a recent issue of securities with no established trading market.  Since the Series A Preferred Stock has no\\nstated maturity date, investors seeking liquidity will be limited to selling their shares in the secondary market or converting their shares and selling in the\\nsecondary market.  We do not intend to list the Series A Preferred Stock on any securities exchange.  We cannot assure you that an active trading market in\\nthe Series A Preferred Stock will develop or, even if it develops, we cannot assure you that it will last. In either case, the trading price of the Series A\\nPreferred Stock could be adversely affected and your ability to transfer your shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be limited. We are not aware of any entity\\n making a market in the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock which we anticipate may further limit liquidity.\\nWith the consent of holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, we may issue additional series of preferred stock that rank equally or superior to the Series A\\nPreferred Stock as to dividend payments and liquidation preference.\\n \\nNeither our Certificate of Incorporation nor the Certificate of Designations for the Series A Preferred Stock prohibits us from issuing additional\\nseries of preferred stock (with the consent of holders of our Series A Preferred Stock) that would rank equally or superior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to\\ndividend payments and liquidation preference. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that we have the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of\\npreferred stock, including up to 700,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The issuances of other series of preferred stock could have the effect of reducing\\nthe amounts available to the Series A Preferred Stock in the event of our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution. It may also reduce cash dividend payments on\\nthe Series A Preferred Stock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all Series A Preferred Stock outstanding and outstanding parity preferred\\nstock.\\n \\n24\\x0cTable of Contents\\nWe are an “emerging growth company” and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may\\nresult in our financial statements not being comparable to those of some other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure\\nrequirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.\\nAs a public reporting company with less than $1,070,000,000 in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company”\\nunder the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting\\nrequirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an\\nemerging growth company we:\\n·\\nare not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial\\nreporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\\n·\\nare not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how\\nthose elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as “compensation discussion and analysis”);\\n·\\nare not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements\\n(commonly referred to as the “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency” and “say-on-golden-parachute” votes);\\n·\\nare exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure;\\n·\\nmay present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial\\nCondition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”); and\\n·\\nare eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act.\\nWe intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of\\nnew or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our\\nfinancial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under\\n§107 of the JOBS Act.\\nCertain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a “smaller\\nreporting company” under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding\\nmanagement’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to\\nprovide a pay-for-performance graph or Chief Executive Officer pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and\\nrelated MD&A disclosure.\\nUnder the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our\\ninitial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or\\nsuch earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an\\n“emerging growth company” if we have more than $1,070,000,000 in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock\\nheld by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Further, under current SEC rules\\nwe will continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” for so long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-\\naffiliates) of less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive due to our reliance on these exemptions.\\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse\\neffect on our business, stock price and the value of our warrants.\\nWe are required to comply with the SEC’s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to\\ncertify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over\\nfinancial reporting. Though we are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis, we will not be required to\\nmake our first annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until year-end 2017. However, as an emerging\\ngrowth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the end of the fiscal year for which our second annual report is due or the date we are no longer an emerging\\ngrowth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the\\nlevel at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\\n \\n25\\x0cTable of Contents\\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have undertaken various actions, and may need to take additional actions, such as\\nimplementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal control can divert\\nour management’s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. Additionally, when evaluating our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for\\ncompliance with the requirements of Section 404. If we identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to\\ncomply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent\\nregistered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting once we are no longer\\nan emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common\\nstock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency, the SEC or other regulatory\\nauthorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of\\nthe Exchange Act. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria\\nestablished in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our\\nassets; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally\\naccepted accounting principles; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with authorizations of management and\\nour directors; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our\\nfinancial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31,\\n2017, our internal control over financial reporting was not yet effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This is largely due to the fact that\\nwe are acquiring privately held companies as part of our growth strategy and our control procedures over all acquired subsidiaries will not be effective until\\nsuch time as we are able to fully integrate the acquisition with our company and set processes and procedures for the acquired entities. We are working to\\nimprove and harmonize our financial reporting controls and procedures across all of our companies.\\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\\nThe Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or\\nchanges in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:\\n·\\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\\n·\\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the\\nresignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\\n·\\nthe ability of our board of directors to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of\\nthose shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of\\na hostile acquirer;\\n·\\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\\n·\\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings; and\\n·\\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to\\nbe acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect\\nthe acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\\n \\n26\\x0cTable of Contents\\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in our board of directors and\\nmanagement.\\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could\\nlimit the opportunity for our security holders to receive a premium for their securities and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for\\nour securities.\\nITEM 1B.

We have not paid any dividends since our inception, and we presently anticipate that all earnings, if any, will be retained for development of our\\nbusiness. The Certificate of Designation for our Series A Preferred Stock prohibits the payment of dividends at any time that we are not current in the\\npayment of dividends with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock.  There are no other restrictions in our certificate of incorporation or by-laws that prevent\\nus from declaring dividends. Any future disposition of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things,\\nour future earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.\\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\\nDuring the past two years, we sold the following securities without registration under the Securities Act:\\nLone Star Value\\nFor the purpose of financing the ongoing business and operations of our company following the Merger, concurrently with the closing of the Merger,\\nwe issued a 5% Unsecured Convertible Note due May 26, 2017, in the principal amount of $5 million (the “Convertible Note”), together with a warrant to\\npurchase shares of our common stock (the “Original Warrant”), in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) to Lone Star Value Investors, LP (“LSVI”),\\npursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 26, 2015.  Prior to the Merger, Lone Star Value was our majority shareholder.  The\\nConvertible Note was unsecured and was to become due on May 26, 2017, the second anniversary of the issue date. Prior to maturity, the Convertible Note\\nbore interest at 5% per annum, with interest being paid semiannually on the first day of each of the first and third calendar quarters. From and after an event\\nof default and for so long as the event of default was continuing, the Convertible Note was to bear default interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The\\nConvertible Note could be prepaid by us at any time without penalty.\\n \\n28\\x0cTable of Contents\\nThe Convertible Note was convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $1.80 per share, or an aggregate of 2,777,778 shares\\nof common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The Convertible Note ranked senior to all of our other obligations, except for trade\\npayables in the ordinary course of business, purchase money asset financing and any inventory or receivables-based credit facility that we may obtain in the\\nfuture, provided that the amount of the credit facility does not exceed 50% of eligible inventory and 80% of eligible receivables. The Convertible Note also\\nincluded certain negative covenants including, without LSVI’s approval, restrictions on debt and security interests, mergers and the purchase and sale of\\nassets, dividends and other restricted payments and investments.\\nThe Original Warrant issued in the Private Placement gave LSVI the right to purchase up to 2,777,777 shares of common stock (equivalent to 100%\\nwarrant coverage in respect of the shares underlying the Convertible Note) at an exercise price equal to $1.80 per share.  The Original Warrant may be\\nexercised on a cashless-exercise basis, meaning that, upon exercise, the holder would make no cash payment to us and would receive a number of shares of\\nour common stock having an aggregate value equal to the excess of the then-current market price of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Original Warrant\\nover the exercise price of the Warrant. The Original Warrant expires on May 26, 2020.\\nOn May 13, 2016, LSVI completed an early partial exercise of its Original Warrant for 1,111,111 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.80 per\\nshare, for total consideration to us of $2 million, and LSVI was issued a replacement warrant for the remaining 1,666,666 shares under the Original Warrant\\non the same terms as the Original Warrant (the “Replacement Warrant”). LSVI also agreed to an amendment of the Convertible Note to extend the maturity of\\nthe Convertible Note for two years in exchange for (i) the right to request that the Board expand the size of the Board to nine directors from the current eight,\\nwith LSVI having the right to designate up to four of the nine directors and (ii) the issuance of an additional warrant (the “Additional Warrant”) for the\\npurchase of 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $6.00 per share, on substantively the same terms as the Original Warrant, except\\nthe Additional Warrant may only be exercised for cash.  LSVI’s Registration Rights Agreement, dated May 26, 2015, with the Company was also amended\\nand restated to include the shares of common stock issuable under the Additional Warrant.\\nOn December 30, 2016, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with LSVI, pursuant to which the\\nConvertible Note was returned to the Company and cancelled in exchange for 363,611 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock, which is non-\\nconvertible and perpetual preferred stock of the Company. As a result of the exchange transaction, no principal or interest remained outstanding or payable\\nunder the Convertible Note and the Convertible Note was no longer convertible into shares of common stock of the Company. We issued 10,097, 10,277 and\\n21,410 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to LSVI in May 2017, September 2017 and December 2017, respectively, as payments of a dividend on the shares\\nof Series A Preferred Stock held by LSVI for each fiscal quarter of 2017.\\nOn September 26, 2017, LSVI completed a cashless exercise of the full Replacement Warrant, of which there was a total of 1,666,666 shares of\\ncommon stock underlying, in exchange for the issuance of 1,205,837 shares of our common stock.\\n2016 Issuances\\nOn April 20, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Dhruwa N. Rai, pursuant to which Mr. Rai purchased 500,000 unregistered\\nshares of our common stock from us at a price per share of $6.00 for aggregate consideration to us of $3 million. Mr. Rai made representations to us regarding\\nhis knowledge and experience, ability to bear economic risk and investment purpose with respect to the restricted shares he purchased.\\nOn June 23, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Bigtech. The acquisition of Bigtech was effective as of July 1, 2016, and as\\npart of the consideration paid for the acquisition, we delivered to Bigtech’s two former shareholders and officers warrants for the purchase of an aggregate\\n51,000 restricted shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the warrants, the former Bigtech shareholders acknowledged that the warrants\\nrepresented unregistered securities that may not be sold or offered except pursuant to an effective registration statement and that any shares issued upon\\nexercise of the warrants would be restricted and held for each such former shareholder’s own account.\\nOn July 22, 2016, we issued 101,250 restricted shares of our common stock to the former sole member and chief executive officer of Virtuoso as part\\nof the total consideration for the acquisition of Virtuoso .The shares were issued with a value of $6.51 per share.

The restricted shares are to be issued on July 29, 2018 or\\nupon a change of control of the Company (whichever occurs earlier). The former members of Ameri Arizona made representations to us regarding their\\nknowledge and experience, ability to bear economic risk and investment purpose with respect to the restricted shares they received.\\n \\n29\\x0cTable of Contents\\nOn September 1, 2016, we issued 299,250 restricted shares of common stock to Srinidhi “Dev” Devanur, our Executive Chairman, in connection\\nwith the completion of our acquisition of Ameri India on July 1, 2016, pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement dated May 26, 2015. Mr.\\nDevanur previously made representations to us regarding his knowledge and experience, ability to bear economic risk and investment purpose with respect to\\nthe restricted shares he acquired.\\n2017 Issuances\\nOn January 27, 2017, we issued 33,333 restricted shares of our common stock its legal counsel, Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP (“Olshan”), in\\nexchange for the cancellation of a portion of accrued and unpaid legal fees owed by us to Olshan. Each of the Olshan partners who received restricted shares\\nis a sophisticated investor with knowledge and experience of financial and business matters related to an investment in our securities. In addition, restricted\\nshares bear transfer restrictions and the recipients acquired such securities for their own respective accounts without a view to resell or distribute them.\\nOn March 7, 2017, we completed the sale and issuance of the 2017 Notes, for proceeds to us of an aggregate of $1.25 million from four accredited\\ninvestors, including one of the Company’s then-directors, Dhruwa N. Rai, and David Luci, who became a director of the Company in February 2018. The\\n2017 Notes were issued pursuant to Securities Purchase Agreements between the Company and each investor. The 2017 Notes bear interest at 8% per annum\\nuntil maturity in March 2020, with interest being paid annually on the first, second and third anniversaries of the issuance of the 2017 Notes beginning in\\nMarch 2018. From and after an event of default and for so long as the event of default is continuing, the 2017 Notes will bear default interest at the rate of\\n10% per annum. The 2017 Notes can be prepaid by us at any time without penalty. As of March 29, 2018, we are not current in the payment of interest on all\\nof the 2017 Notes and are in discussion with holders of the 2017 notes for which we are not current in the payment of interest to negotiate longer payment\\nterms until we are able to raise more capital.\\nThe 2017 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $2.80 per share. The holders of the 2017 Notes have\\nthe right, at their option, at any time and from time to time to convert, in part or in whole, the outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest\\nunder the 2017 Notes into shares of our common stock.  The 2017 Notes rank junior to our secured credit facility with Sterling National Bank. The 2017\\nNotes also include certain negative covenants including, without the investors’ approval, restrictions on dividends and other restricted payments and\\nreclassification of its stock. The 2017 Notes purchasers made representations to us regarding their knowledge and experience, ability to bear economic risk\\nand investment purpose with respect to the 2017 Notes they purchased.

On May 26, 2015, we completed a “reverse merger” transaction, in which we caused Ameri100 Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware\\ncorporation as our newly created, wholly owned subsidiary, to be merged with and into Ameri and Partners (doing business as Ameri100), a Delaware\\ncorporation. As a result of the Merger, Ameri and Partners became our wholly owned subsidiary with Ameri and Partners’ former stockholders acquiring a\\nmajority of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The Merger was consummated under Delaware law, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and in\\nconnection with the Merger we changed our name to AMERI Holdings, Inc. Since the Merger, we have been an active holding company headquartered in\\nPrinceton, New Jersey, with offices across the United States that are supported by offices in India.\\n \\n31\\x0cTable of Contents\\nOverview\\nWe specialize in delivering SAP cloud, digital and enterprise services to clients worldwide. Our SAP focus allows us to provide technological\\nsolutions to a broad and growing base of clients. Our model inverts the conventional global delivery model wherein offshore IT service providers are based\\nabroad and maintain a minimal presence in the United States. With a strong SAP focus, our client partnerships anchor around SAP cloud and digital services.\\nWe pursue an acquisition strategy that seeks to disrupt the established business model of offshore IT service providers.\\nWe partnered with NEC Corporation of America (NEC), in February 2017, to offer SAP HANA Migration services. Through this partnership, the\\nCompany will offer solutions to its clients aspiring to make the transition from SAP ECC (on-premise) applications to SAP HANA applications. NEC is a\\nleading technology integrator providing integrated communications, analytics, security, biometrics and technology solutions.\\nWe generate revenue by providing consulting services under written service contracts with our customers. The service contracts we enter into\\ngenerally fall into two categories: (1) time-and-materials contracts and (2) fixed-price contracts.\\nWhen a customer enters into a time-and-materials or fixed-price (or a periodic retainer-based) contract, the revenue is recognized in accordance with\\nthe deliverables of each contract. If the deliverables involve separate units of accounting, the consideration from the arrangement is measured and allocated to\\nthe separate units, based on vendor specific objective evidence of the value for each deliverable.\\nThe revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates. Revenue\\npursuant to fixed-price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting. We routinely evaluate whether revenue and\\nprofitability should be recognized in the current period. We estimate the proportional performance on fixed-price contracts on a monthly basis utilizing hours\\nincurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project.\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, sales to five major customers accounted for approximately 43% and 53% of our\\ntotal revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, one of our customers contributed 11% of our revenue, and for year ended December 31,\\n2016, two of our customers contributed 16% and 13% of our revenues, respectively.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we streamlined our operations by eliminating redundant positions across our acquired entities, which\\nresulted in a restructuring charge of approximately $0.4 million and the elimination of 26 employees. We anticipate that streamlining of our operations will\\nresult in annual savings of approximately $1.75 million, inclusive of payroll, benefits, office consolidations and other ancillary employee related costs.\\nWe continue to explore strategic alternatives to improve the market position and profitability of our product and service offerings in the marketplace,\\ngenerate additional liquidity for the Company, and enhance our valuation. We plan to pursue our goals during the next twelve months principally through\\norganic growth and through strategic alternatives. Some of these alternatives have included, and could continue to include, selective acquisitions. We have\\nobtained financing and additional capital from the sale of equity and incurrence of indebtedness in the past, and we continue to consider capital raising and\\nfinancing from the sale of various types of equity and incurrence of indebtedness to provide capital for our business plans and operations in the future.\\nMatters that May or Are Currently Affecting Our Business\\nThe main challenges and trends that could affect or are affecting our financial results include:\\n·\\nOur ability to enter into additional technology-management and consulting agreements, to diversify our client base and to expand the geographic\\nareas we serve;\\n·\\nOur ability to attract competent, skilled professionals and on-demand technology partners for our operations at acceptable prices to manage our\\noverhead;\\n·\\nOur ability to acquire other technology services companies and integrate them with our existing business;\\n·\\nOur ability to raise additional equity capital, if and when we needed;\\n·\\nWe may incur an impairment of the goodwill acquired from our prior business acquisitions if our acquired entities do not experience growth;\\nand\\n·\\nOur ability to control our costs of operation as we expand our organization and capabilities.\\n \\n32\\x0cTable of Contents\\nWe have incurred significant and recurring operational losses as a result of our ongoing acquisition strategy. We have outstanding cash payment\\nobligations related to our past acquisitions of approximately $4.3 million.  In addition, under the terms of our Series A Preferred Stock, we are currently\\nobligated to pay approximately $2 million in dividends per year on such stock through fiscal year 2019. If our current cash position does not improve\\nsignificantly, we will not have sufficient cash on hand to meet these obligations.  Due to our working capital constraints, we are not current in all payments to\\nall our unsecured noteholders. We are working with certain of our unsecured noteholders to negotiate payment terms until we are able to raise more capital.\\n \\nOperational streamlining that was completed in 2017 is anticipated to provide cash savings of approximately $1.75 million per year. We believe\\nadditional cost-cutting efforts will further reduce cash used in operations.  In addition, we believe that we can obtain additional external financing to meet\\nfuture cash requirements. We raised $1.25 million in March 2017 through the sale of convertible notes and over $6.7 million in gross proceeds through our\\npublic offering of common stock and warrants in November 2017.\\n \\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional sources of capital or that cost savings will provide sufficient working capital.  If\\nwe continue to be unable to pay all outstanding payments under our unsecured notes, the unpaid noteholders may take legal action against us, they may\\naccelerate the payment of the principal under the applicable notes, and our senior secured lender may call a cross-default under our existing credit facility,\\nwhich could result in the acceleration of the obligations thereunder and have a negative impact on our revenue and financial results.  Should we be unable to\\nraise sufficient debt or equity capital, we could be forced to cease operations. Our plan regarding these matters is to work to raise additional debt and/or\\nequity financing to allow us the ability to cover our current cash flow requirements and meet our obligations as they become due. There can be no assurances\\nthat financing will be available or if available, that such financing will be available under favorable terms.\\nResult of Operations\\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\\n \\n \\nTwelve Months\\nEnded December 31,\\n \\n \\n2017\\n  \\n2016\\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\nNet revenue\\n $\\n48,593,712  $\\n36,145,589 \\nCost of revenue\\n  \\n38,355,967   \\n29,217,186 \\nGross profit\\n  \\n10,237,745   \\n6,928,403 \\n  \\n    \\n  \\nOperating expenses:\\n  \\n    \\n  \\nSelling, general and administration\\n  \\n18,510,120   \\n9,361,961 \\nAcquisition related expenses\\n  \\n481,123   \\n1,585,136 \\nDepreciation and amortization\\n  \\n3,217,191   \\n1,361,169 \\nOperating expenses\\n  \\n22,208,434   \\n12,308,266 \\nOperating (loss):\\n  \\n(11,970,689)   \\n(5,379,863)\\n  \\n    \\n  \\nInterest expense\\n  \\n(575,039)   \\n(751,074)\\nOther income\\n  \\n4,995   \\n16,604 \\nChange due to estimates\\n  \\n1,074,158   \\n(410,817)\\nTotal other income /(expenses)\\n  \\n504,114   \\n(1,145,287)\\n(Loss) before income taxes\\n  \\n(11,466,575)   \\n(6,525,150)\\nIncome tax benefit\\n  \\n2,391,762   \\n3,747,846 \\nNet (loss)\\n  \\n(9,074,813)   \\n(2,777,304)\\nNon-controlling interest\\n  \\n-   \\n(3,382)\\nNet (loss) attributable to the Company\\n  \\n(9,570,632)   \\n(2,780,686)\\nDividend on preferred stock\\n  \\n(2,089,151)   \\n- \\nNet (loss) attributable to common stock holders\\n  \\n(11,163,964)   \\n(2,780,686)\\nOther comprehensive income/ (loss), net of tax:\\n  \\n    \\n  \\nForeign exchange translation adjustment\\n  \\n44,301   \\n(7,426)\\nTotal comprehensive (loss)\\n $\\n(11,119,663)   \\n(2,788,112)\\nComprehensive (loss) attributable to the Company\\n  \\n(11,119,663)   \\n(2,784,730)\\nComprehensive (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest\\n  \\n-   \\n(3,382)\\n  \\n(11,119,663)   \\n(2,788,112)\\nBasic (loss) per share\\n $\\n(0.75)  $\\n(0.21)\\nDiluted (loss) per share\\n $\\n(0.75)  $\\n(0.21)\\n  \\n    \\n  \\nBasic weighted average number of shares\\n  \\n14,982,791   \\n13,068,597 \\nDiluted weighted average number of shares\\n  \\n14,982,791   \\n13,068,597 \\n \\n33\\x0cTable of Contents\\nRevenues\\n \\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $12.45 million, or 34.4%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.  This\\nincrease was primarily attributable to our acquisition of Ameri California in 2017 and the inclusion of Ameri Arizona’s full year results in 2017, whereas only\\nfive months of Ameri Arizona’s results were included in our 2016 financials following its acquisition in late July 2016. Our Ameri and Partners and Ameri\\nGeorgia subsidiaries, together, experienced a decline in revenue in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to attrition of low margin business.

We derived most of our revenues from our customers located in North\\nAmerica for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\\nGross Margin\\nOur gross margin was 21% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 19% for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Gross margin from\\nAmeri California, which was acquired in March 2017, was 26%; without this acquisition our gross margin would have been 20%.\\nOur target gross margins in future periods are anticipated to be in the range of 20% to 25% based on a mix of project revenues and professional\\nservice revenues. However, there is no assurance that we will achieve such anticipated gross margins.\\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses\\nSelling, general and administration (“SG&A”) expenses include all costs, including rent costs, which are not directly associated with revenue-\\ngenerating activities, as well as the non-cash expense for stock based compensation. These include employee costs, corporate costs and facilities costs.\\nEmployee costs include administrative salaries and related employee benefits, travel, recruiting and training costs. Corporate costs include reorganization\\ncosts, legal, accounting and outside consulting fees. Facilities costs primarily include rent and communications costs.\\nSG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $18.5 million, as compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. \\nSG&A expenses increased by $9.5 million, of which $5.6 million was attributable to stock based compensation expense due to grants made to our employees,\\naccelerated expenses upon cancellation of restricted stock units in the second quarter of 2017, a charge related to the cashless exercise of warrant exercised by\\nLSVI in the third quarter of 2017 and stock compensation expenses incurred due to the issuance of shares to a director as a bonus for services provided to the\\nCompany in 2017.\\nOur acquisition of Ameri California added an additional $2.2 million to our SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017. The remaining\\nincrease in SG&A was attributable to the full-year results of our 2016 acquisitions in our 2017 fiscal year, while they only contributed to our results for a\\nportion of 2016.\\n \\n34\\x0cTable of Contents\\nDepreciation and Amortization\\nDepreciation and amortization expense amounted to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.4 million for the year\\nended December 31, 2016. We capitalized the customer lists acquired during various acquisitions, resulting in increased amortization costs. The customer lists\\nfrom each acquisition are amortized over a period of 60 months.  Our amortization schedule is as follows:\\nYear ending December 31,\\n \\nAmount\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n2018\\n  \\n2,825,148 \\n2019\\n  \\n2,457,806 \\n2020\\n  \\n2,326,000 \\n2021\\n  \\n1,510,749 \\n2022\\n  \\n350,000 \\nTotal\\n $\\n9,469,703 \\nOperating loss\\nOur operating loss was $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\\nThis increase in loss was mainly due to the significant increase in stock based compensation expenses and incremental expenses from acquired entities in\\n2017 and 2016.\\nInterest Expense\\nOur interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.6 million as compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\\nThe decrease was mainly due to differences in interest rates in 2017 as compared to 2016.\\nChanges in Estimates\\nChanges in estimates represents a reduction of $1.1 million in contingent consideration payable for previously acquired entities which did not meet\\ntheir earn-out targets.\\nIncome Taxes\\nOur benefit from income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $2.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The\\nbenefits from income taxes are due to recurring net operating losses of the Company.\\nAcquisition Related Expenses\\nWe had acquisition related expenditures of $0.5 million and $1.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016,\\nrespectively. These expenses included legal, professional services, valuation and due diligence services and other acquisition related fees incurred in\\nconnection with our acquisitions. The decrease was due to the decline in acquisition related activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the\\nyear ended December 31, 2016.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nOur cash position was $4.9 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.4 million as of December 31, 2016.  The increase in our cash\\nposition was primarily due to the funds received from our November 2017 public offering.  We currently anticipate payments of $5.5 million toward cash\\nobligations in respect of completed acquisitions, including for the payment of potential earn-outs during the next 12 months.\\nCash used for operating activities was $2.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.  We were able to control the\\nlevel of cash used for operating activities from year to year through cost-cutting measures that reduced working capital requirements. Cash used in investing\\nactivities was $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash provided by financing activities was $7.0 million during the year ended December\\n31, 2017 and was attributable to the sale of common stock and warrants in our November 2017 public offering, our private placement of convertible notes in\\nMarch 2017 and net bank borrowings.\\n \\n35\\x0cTable of Contents\\nPublic Offering\\nOn November 21, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,475,000 shares of our common stock, at a price of $4.115 per share, and\\nwarrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,475,000 shares of our common stock, at a price of $0.01 per warrant. The warrants have a per share exercise\\nprice of $4.115, were exercisable as of November 21, 2017 and expire five years from that date. The gross proceeds to us from this offering were\\napproximately $6,084,375, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses.  In connection with the offering,\\nwe uplisted our common stock from the OTCQB Marketplace to trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “AMRH”, and we listed the\\npublicly offered warrants for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “AMRHW”.\\nOn January 24, 2018, we received confirmation from our transfer agent, Corporate Stock Transfer, Inc., which also serves as the warrant agent for\\nthe public warrant, that through such date certain holders of warrants had cumulatively exercised warrants for the purchase of a total of 153,060 shares of our\\ncommon stock, at an exercise price of $4.115 per share, for gross proceeds to us of $629,841.90.\\nLiquidity Concerns\\nWe incurred recurring losses as a result of costs and expenses related to our selling, general and administration activities. As of December 31, 2017,\\nwe had negative working capital of $15.7 million and cash of $4.9 million. Our principal sources of cash have included bank borrowings, the private\\nplacement of convertible notes and the public offering of securities. To increase revenues, our operating expenses are likely to continue to grow and, as a\\nresult, we will need to generate significant additional revenues to cover such expenses.\\nOur financial statements as of December 31, 2017 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our ability to\\ncontinue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional funding through the issuance of equity or debt securities, as well as to attain\\nfurther operating efficiencies and, ultimately, to generate additional revenues. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from\\nthe outcome of this uncertainty. We can give no assurances that additional capital that we are able to obtain, if any, will be sufficient to meet our needs. The\\nforegoing conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue our operations.\\n \\nAvailable Credit Facility, Borrowings and Repayment of Debt\\nOn July 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), with its wholly-owned subsidiaries Ameri and\\nPartners and Ameri Georgia, as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Linear Logics, Corp. and WinHire Inc.\\n(dissolved in March 2017) serving as guarantors, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, serving as a validity guarantor, and Sterling National Bank,\\nN.A. (as lender and as agent, “Sterling”). The Company joined Ameri California, Virtuoso and Ameri Arizona as borrowers under the Loan Agreement\\nfollowing their respective acquisition.\\n \\nUnder the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers can borrow up to an aggregate of $10 million, which includes up to $8 million in principal for revolving\\nloans (the “Revolving Loans”) for general working capital purposes, up to $2 million in principal pursuant to a term loan (the “Term Loan”) for the purpose\\nof a permitted business acquisition and up to $200,000 for letters of credit. A portion of the proceeds of the Loan Agreement were also used to repay the\\nNovember 20, 2015 credit facility that was entered into between the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Ameri Georgia and Federal National Payables,\\nInc.\\nThe maturity of the loans under the Loan Agreement are as follows:\\nRevolving Loan Maturity Date: July 1, 2019; provided, however, that the Revolving Loan Maturity Date will extend and renew automatically for\\nsuccessive one-year terms on each anniversary of the initial Revolving Loan Maturity Date (each an “Anniversary Date”) thereafter, unless not less than sixty\\n(60) days prior to any such Anniversary Date, written notice of non-renewal is given by either party to the other, in which case the Revolving Loan Maturity\\nDate will be such next Anniversary Date.\\nTerm Loan Maturity Date: The earliest of (a) the date following acceleration of the Term Loan and/or the Revolving Loans; (b) the Revolving Loan\\nMaturity Date; or (c) July 1, 2019.\\nInterest under the Loan Agreement is payable monthly in arrears and accrues as follows:\\n(a) in the case of Revolving Loans, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus (ii) 2.00%;\\n(b) in the case of the Term Loan, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus (ii) 3.75%; and\\n \\n36\\x0cTable of Contents\\n(c) in the case of other obligations of the Borrowers, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (A) 3.25% or (B) Wall Street Journal\\nPrime Rate plus (ii) 3.75%.\\nThe Loan Agreement also requires the payment of certain fees, including, but not limited to letter of credit fees and an unused Revolving Loans fee.\\nThe Loan Agreement contains financial and other covenant requirements, including, but not limited to, financial covenants that require the\\nBorrowers to not permit capital expenditures above $150,000 in any fiscal year, maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00 and\\nmaintain certain debt to EBITDA ratios. The Loan Agreement also requires the Company and Borrowers to obtain Sterling’s consent before making any\\npermitted acquisitions. The amounts borrowed by the Borrowers under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed by the guarantors, and the Loan Agreement is\\nsecured by substantially all of the Borrowers’ assets.\\nThe principal amount of the Term Loan will be repaid as follows: (i) equal consecutive monthly installments in the amount of $33,333.33 each, paid\\non the first day of each calendar month and (ii) one final payment of the entire remaining principal balance, together with all accrued unpaid interest on the\\nTerm Loan maturity date.\\nOn August 28, 2017, pursuant to an amendment of the Loan Agreement, we and certain of our subsidiaries obtained an incremental term loan from\\nSterling National Bank in the amount of $343,200.58, which amount was an addition to and comprised a part of the existing Term Loan under the existing\\nLoan Agreement. In January 2018, we repaid the incremental term loan.\\nTo date, we are not in compliance with the financial covenants contained in its Loan Agreement with Sterling National Bank. We received waivers\\nfrom Sterling National Bank for our non-compliance with the Loan Agreement for the quarters ended March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017\\nand December 31, 2017 in exchange for the payment of a fee of $5,000 for each quarterly waiver. We do not expect Sterling National Bank to continue\\nto grant further waivers for continued non-compliance.\\nIf we are not in compliance with the Loan Agreement in the future and we are unable to obtain future waivers from Sterling National Bank, the bank\\ncould declare our loans with it to be in default and elect to claim all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments\\nto extend further credit. If we are unable to repay the outstanding amounts, Sterling National Bank could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure\\nour indebtedness to it. We pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement is also supported by a validity\\nguaranty from our former Chief Executive Officer. If Sterling National Bank accelerates the repayment of our loans, there is no assurance that we will have\\nsufficient assets to repay the loans. A default under the Loan Agreement may also result in an event of default under the 2017 Notes. We are currently looking\\nfor additional sources of financing, however there is no guarantee that we will have additional financing available to us.\\nInterest paid on the Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $0.15 million. Principal repaid on the Term Loan during the\\nyear ended December 31, 2017 was $0.4 million. The short term and long-term outstanding balances on the Term Loan as of December 31, 2017 were $0.7\\nmillion and $1.1 million, respectively. The outstanding balance of the Revolving Loans as of December 31, 2017 was $3.7 million.\\nBigtech, which was acquired as of July 1, 2016, had a term loan of $0.01 million and a line of credit for $0.36 million as of December 31, 2017. The\\nBigtech line of credit is with an Indian bank, HDFC Bank Limited, and was entered into on September 3, 2015 for Bigtech’s working capital requirements.\\nThe line of credit is for up to $0.42 million with an interest rate of 11.85% per annum and maturity in June 2020. The Bigtech term loan accrues interest at the\\nrate of 10.30% per annum and matures in 2020. Both the term loan and the line of credit were already in place when the Company acquired Bigtech. Interest\\npaid during the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $2,015 for the term loan and $37,719 line of credit held by Bigtech.\\nFor the purpose of financing the ongoing business and operations of our company, on April 20, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement\\nwith Dhruwa N. Rai, pursuant to which Mr. Rai purchased 500,000 unregistered shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, from us at a price per\\nshare of $6.00 for aggregate consideration to us of $3 million.\\nOn May 13, 2016, LSVI completed an early partial exercise of its Original Warrant for 1,111,111 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.80 per\\nshare, for total consideration to us of $2 million, and LSVI was issued the Replacement Warrant for the remaining 1,666,666 shares under the Original\\nWarrant on the same terms as the Original Warrant.\\nOn March 7, 2017, we completed the sale and issuance of the 2017 Notes for aggregate proceeds to us of $1.25 million from four accredited\\ninvestors, including one of the Company’s then-directors, Dhruwa N. Rai, and David Luci, who became a director of the Company in February 2018. The\\n2017 Notes were issued pursuant to Securities Purchase Agreements between the Company and each investor. The 2017 Notes bear interest at 8% per annum\\nuntil maturity in March 2020, with interest being paid annually on the first, second and third anniversaries of the issuance of the 2017 Notes beginning in\\nMarch 2018. From and after an event of default and for so long as the event of default is continuing, the 2017 Notes will bear default interest at the rate of\\n10% per annum. The 2017 Notes can be prepaid by us at any time without penalty. As of March 29, 2018, we are not current in the payment of interest on all\\nof the 2017 Notes and are in discussion with holders of the 2017 notes for which we are not current in the payment of interest to negotiate longer payment\\nterms until we are able to raise more capital.\\n \\n37\\x0cTable of Contents\\nThe 2017 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $2.80. The holders of the 2017 Notes have the right,\\nat their option, at any time and from time to time to convert, in part or in whole, the outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest under\\nthe 2017 Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price.\\nThe 2017 Notes rank junior to our secured credit facility with Sterling National Bank. The 2017 Notes also include certain negative covenants\\nincluding, without the investors’ approval, restrictions on dividends and other restricted payments and reclassification of its stock.\\nFuture Sources of Liquidity\\n \\nWe expect our primary sources of cash to be customer collections and external financing. We also continue to work on cost reductions, and we have\\ninitiated steps to reduce our overhead to improve cash savings.  We may raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities or borrowings\\nfrom financial institutions or third parties or a combination of the foregoing. Capital raised will be used to implement our business plan, grow current\\n operations, make acquisitions or start new vertical businesses among some of the possible uses.\\nAccounts Receivable\\nAccounts receivable for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $8.9 million as compared to $8.0 million as on December 31, 2016. While Ameri\\nCalifornia contributed $2.3 million to our accounts receivables in 2017, our accounts receivable did not increase by that amount due to a reduction in accounts\\nreceivable of our other subsidiaries.\\nAccounts Payable\\nAccounts payable for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.3 million as compared to $5.1 million as on December 31, 2016. While Ameri\\nCalifornia contributed $1 million to our accounts payable in 2017, our accounts payable did not increase by that amount due to a reduction in accounts\\npayable of our other subsidiaries.\\nOther Accrued Expenses\\nAccrued expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2.6 million as compared to $2.1 as on December 31, 2016. While Ameri California\\ncontributed $0.5 million to our accrued expenses in 2017, our accrued expenses did not increase by that amount due to a reduction in accrued expenses of our\\nother subsidiaries.\\nCommitments and Contingencies\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and\\ncommercial commitments:\\n \\n \\nPayments due by period\\n \\n \\n \\nTotal\\n  \\nLess than\\n1 year\\n  \\n1-3 years\\n  \\n3+ years\\n \\nLong-term debt obligations\\n $\\n1,880,114  $\\n749,551  $\\n1,130,563  $\\n- \\nOperating lease obligations\\n  \\n268,992   \\n123,873   \\n145,119   \\n- \\nTotal\\n $\\n2,149,106  $\\n873,424  $\\n1,275,682  $\\n- \\nForeign Currency Risk\\nOverall, we believe that we have limited currency risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as most of our revenues are\\nderived from customers located in North America.\\n \\n38\\x0cTable of Contents\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\\nSeasonality\\nOur operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations. However, our consultants’ billable hours are affected by national holidays and\\nvacation policies, which vary by country.\\nClimate Change\\nWe do not believe there is anything unique to our business which would result in climate change regulations having a disproportional effect on us as\\ncompared to U.S. industry overall.\\nImpact of Inflation\\nWe do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, we attempt to\\nminimize any effects of inflation on our operating results by controlling operating costs and, whenever possible, seeking to ensure that billing rates reflect\\nincreases in costs due to inflation.\\nCritical Accounting Policies\\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with the Accounting Standard Codification 605 “Revenue Recognition.” Revenue is\\nrecognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been\\nrendered, (3) the seller’s price to buyer is fixed and determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from information\\ntechnology services as the services are provided. Service revenues are recognized based on contracted hourly rates, as services are rendered or upon\\ncompletion of specified contracted services and acceptance by the customer.\\nStock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and non-employee directors is\\ndetermined based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. We recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite\\nservice period of the award. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original\\nestimates.\\nImpairment. Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, and certain other assets to be held and used by us, are reviewed when\\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. If this\\nassessment indicates that the carrying values will not be recoverable, as determined based on undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful lives, an\\nimpairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset.\\nIncome Taxes. We provide for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred income taxes are\\nrecorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at\\neach balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable\\nincome. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation\\nallowance is provided. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes\\nthe enactment date. Tax benefits earned on employee stock awards in excess of recorded stock-based compensation expense are credited to additional paid-in\\ncapital. Our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related interest.\\nAccounts Receivable. We extend credit to clients based upon management’s assessment of their credit-worthiness on an unsecured basis. We provide\\nan allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience and management evaluation of trend analysis. We include any balances that are\\ndetermined to be uncollectible in allowance for doubtful accounts.\\nBusiness Combination. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires the identification of the acquirer, the\\ndetermination of the acquisition date and the allocation of the purchase price paid by the acquirer to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired,\\nthe liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill\\nrepresents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets.\\nIdentifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are\\nincurred. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\\n \\n39\\x0cTable of Contents\\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangibles. We evaluate goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances\\nwarrant. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. For purchased intangible\\nassets, if our annual qualitative assessment indicates possible impairment, we test the assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of such assets to their\\ncarrying value. In determining the fair value, we utilize various estimates and assumptions, including discount rates and projections of future cash flows. If an\\nimpairment is indicated, a write down to the implied fair value of goodwill or fair value of intangible asset is recorded.\\nValuation of Contingent Earn-out Consideration. Acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on the achievement of certain\\nfuture financial performance measures of the acquired company. Contingent consideration is required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.\\nWe estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement. We believe\\nour estimates and assumptions are reasonable, however, there is significant judgment involved. We evaluate, on a routine, periodic basis, the estimated fair\\nvalue of the contingent consideration and changes in estimated fair value, subsequent to the initial fair value estimate at the time of the acquisition, will be\\nreflected in income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from\\nchanges in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates and changes in probability assumptions with\\nrespect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria. Any changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration may have a material\\nimpact on our operating results.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from\\nContracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605).” This ASU requires an\\nentity to recognize revenue when goods are transferred or services are provided to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity\\nexpects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the\\nnature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,\\n“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), deferral of the Effective Date.” With the issuance of ASU 2015-14, the new revenue guidance ASU\\n2014-09 will be effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, using one of two\\nprescribed retrospective methods. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customer (Topic 606), Identifying\\nPerformance Obligations and Licensing.” The guidance is applicable from the date of applicability of ASU 2014-09. This ASU finalizes the amendments to\\nthe guidance on the new revenue standard on the identification of performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. In December\\n2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements (Topic 606)” which is applicable from the date of applicability of ASU\\n2014-09. This guidance provides optional exemptions from the disclosure requirement for remaining performance obligations for specific situations in which\\nan entity need not estimate variable consideration to recognize revenue. In May 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, “Narrow-Scope Improvements and\\nPractical Expedients”. This amendment clarified certain aspects of Topic 606 and will be applicable from the date of applicability of ASU 2014-09. We have\\nadopted this accounting standard as of January 1, 2018 and we do not believe the new accounting standard will have a material impact on our financial\\nstatements.\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”. This new standard replaces the existing guidance on leases and\\nrequires the lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with lease terms equal to or greater than twelve months. For finance\\nleases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize total lease\\nexpense on a straight-line basis. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15,\\n2018. Upon adoption, entities will be required to use a modified retrospective transition which provides for certain practical expedients. Entities are required\\nto apply the new standard at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Early adoption of this new standard is permitted. The Company is\\ncurrently evaluating the effect this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We do not expect the requirement\\nto recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for operating leases to have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated statements of\\nfinancial position.\\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\\n(ASU 2016-15), which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is\\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Based on its current assessment, the Company\\ndoes not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\\nOn November 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which is intended to reduce\\ndiversity in the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. This new standard requires that restricted cash\\nand restricted cash equivalents be included as components of total cash and cash equivalents as presented on the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities\\nwill no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. ASU\\n2016-18 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years, but earlier adoption is\\npermitted.  We do not believe the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\n \\n40\\x0cTable of Contents\\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. Under this new standard, goodwill impairment\\nwould be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. This ASU\\neliminates existing guidance that requires an entity to determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by hypothetically\\nassigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. This update is\\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual\\ngoodwill impairment test performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are in in process of evaluating the impact of these updates.\\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies and provides a more robust framework\\nto use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective\\ndate. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted for\\nacquisition or deconsolidation transactions occurring before the issuance date or effective date and only when the transactions have not been reported in\\nissued or made available for issuance financial statements. We do not believe the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on our\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nITEM 7A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nManagement’s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the\\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and\\nforms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to\\nallow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that\\nany controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,\\nand our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of its inherent\\nlimitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can\\nprovide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\\nprocedures may deteriorate.\\n \\n41\\x0cTable of Contents\\nAs required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, being December\\n31, 2017, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. This\\nevaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Company’s management, including our Company’s Chief Executive Officer\\nand Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our company’s\\ndisclosure controls and procedures are not yet effective as of the end of the period covered by this report as noted below in management’s report on internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting. This is largely due to the fact that we are acquiring privately held companies as part of our growth strategy and our control\\nprocedures over all acquired subsidiaries will not be effective until such time as we are able to fully integrate the acquisition with our company and set\\nprocesses and procedures for the acquired entities.  We are working to improve and harmonize our financial reporting controls and procedures across all of\\nour companies.  There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have\\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.\\n \\nDisclosure controls and procedures and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or\\nsubmitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules\\nand forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be\\ndisclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management including our Chief Executive\\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and\\nprocedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource\\nconstraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of\\ncontrols can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\\n \\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of\\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\\n2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\\nCommission. Our internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions\\nand dispositions of our assets; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with\\nauthorizations of management and our directors; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could\\nhave a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this assessment, our management concluded\\nthat, as of December 31, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting was not yet effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  This is\\nlargely due to the fact that we are acquiring privately held companies as part of our growth strategy and our control procedures over all acquired subsidiaries\\nwill not be effective until such time as we are able to fully integrate the acquisition with our company and set processes and procedures for the acquired\\nentities.  We are working to improve and harmonize our financial reporting controls and procedures across all of our companies.\\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent auditors regarding internal control over financial reporting.\\nManagement’s report was not subject to attestation by our independent auditors pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit our company to provide\\nonly management’s report in this annual report.\\n \\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\\nInternal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice\\nand guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization and personnel factors.\\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process, which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns\\nresulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of\\nits inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations\\nare known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\\nTherefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and\\npresentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes\\n in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n \\nNone.\\n \\nITEM 9B.

AMERI Holdings, Inc.’s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\\non these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that\\nwe plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The\\nCompany is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration\\nof internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of\\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit\\nincludes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the\\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that\\nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\\nDecember 31, 2017 and 2016 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017 and 2016,

Contents\\nAMERI HOLDINGS, INC.\\n \\nNOTES TO AUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nDECEMBER 31, 2017\\nNOTE 1.\\nORGANIZATION:\\nAMERI Holdings, Inc. (“AMERI”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”) is a fast-growing company that, through the operations of its twelve subsidiaries, provides\\nSAP TM cloud and digital enterprise services to clients worldwide. Headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, we typically go to market both vertically by\\nindustry and horizontally by product/technology specialties and provide our customers with a wide range of business and technology offerings. We work with\\n customers, primarily within North America, to improve process, reduce costs and increase revenue through the judicious use of technology.\\nNOTE 2.\\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\\nBasis of Preparation. The accompanying audited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by AMERI pursuant to the rules\\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) regarding annual financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures\\nnormally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have\\nbeen omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to ensure the information presented is not\\nmisleading.\\n \\nThe accompanying audited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which were of a normal, recurring nature) that, in the\\nopinion of management, are necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the interim periods presented.\\nThese financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto.\\n \\n Our comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) plus or minus any periodic currency translation adjustments.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All\\nintercompany transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying audited condensed consolidated financial statements.\\n \\nRevenue Recognition.  We recognize revenue primarily through the provision of consulting services. We generate revenue by providing consulting\\nservices under written service contracts with our customers. The service contracts we enter generally fall into two categories: (1) time-and-materials contracts\\nand (2) fixed-price contracts.\\nWe consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable and\\ncollectability is reasonably assured. We establish billing terms at the time at which the project deliverables and milestones are agreed. Our standard payment\\nterms are 60 days from invoice date.\\nWhen a customer enters into a time-and-materials or fixed-price (or a periodic retainer-based) contract, the Company recognizes revenue in\\naccordance with its evaluation of the deliverables in each contract. If the deliverables represent separate units of accounting, the Company then measures and\\nallocates the consideration from the arrangement to the separate units, based on vendor specific objective evidence of the value for each deliverable.\\nThe revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates. Revenue\\npursuant to fixed-price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting. We routinely evaluate whether revenue and\\nprofitability should be recognized in the current period. We estimate the proportional performance on our fixed-price contracts on a monthly basis utilizing\\nhours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. This method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of costs\\nand revenue earned can be made, based on historical experience and milestones identified in any particular contract. If we do not have a sufficient basis to\\nmeasure progress toward completion, revenue is recognized upon completion of performance, subject to any warranty provisions or other project management\\nassessments as to the status of work performed.\\n \\nF-7\\x0cTable of Contents\\nEstimates of total project costs are continuously monitored during the term of an engagement. There are situations where the number of hours to\\ncomplete projects may exceed our original estimate, as a result of an increase in project scope, unforeseen events that arise, or the inability of the client or the\\ndelivery team to fulfill their responsibilities. Accordingly, recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision throughout the life of a project based on current\\ninformation and historical trends. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial\\nstatements in the periods in which they are first identified.\\nIf our initial estimates of the resources required or the scope of work to be performed on a contract are inaccurate, or we do not manage the project\\nproperly within the planned time period, a provision for estimated losses on incomplete projects may be made. Any known or probable losses on projects are\\ncharged to operations in the period in which such losses are determined. A formal project review process takes place quarterly, although projects are\\ncontinuously evaluated throughout the period. Management reviews the estimated total direct costs on each contract to determine if the estimated amounts are\\naccurate, and estimates are adjusted as needed in the period identified. No losses were recognized on contracts during the period ended December 31, 2017.\\nStock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and non-employee directors is\\ndetermined based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. We recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite\\nservice period of the award. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original\\nestimates.\\nImpairment. Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, and certain other assets to be held and used by us, are reviewed when\\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. If this\\nassessment indicates that the carrying values will not be recoverable, as determined based on undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful lives, an\\nimpairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset.\\n \\nIncome Taxes. We provide for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred income taxes are\\nrecorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at\\neach balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable\\nincome. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation\\nallowance is provided. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes\\nthe enactment date. Tax benefits earned on employee stock awards in excess of recorded stock-based compensation expense are credited to additional paid-in\\ncapital. Our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related interest.\\nAccounts Receivable. We extend credit to clients based upon management’s assessment of their credit-worthiness on an unsecured basis. We provide\\nan allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience and management evaluation of trend analysis. We include any balances that are\\ndetermined to be uncollectible in allowance for doubtful accounts.\\n \\nBusiness Combinations. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires the identification of the acquirer, the\\ndetermination of the acquisition date and the allocation of the purchase price paid by the acquirer to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired,\\nthe liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill\\nrepresents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets.\\nIdentifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are\\nincurred. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangibles. We evaluate goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances\\nwarrant. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. For purchased intangible\\nassets, if our annual qualitative assessment indicates possible impairment, we test the assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of such assets to their\\ncarrying value. In determining the fair value, we utilize various estimates and assumptions, including discount rates and projections of future cash flows. If an\\nimpairment is indicated, a write down to the implied fair value of goodwill or fair value of intangible asset is recorded.\\nValuation of Contingent Earn-out Consideration. Acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on the achievement of certain\\nfuture financial performance measures of the acquired company. Contingent consideration is required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.\\nWe estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement. We believe\\nour estimates and assumptions are reasonable, however, there is significant judgment involved. We evaluate, on a routine, periodic basis, the estimated fair\\nvalue of the contingent consideration and changes in estimated fair value, subsequent to the initial fair value estimate at the time of the acquisition, will be\\nreflected in income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from\\nchanges in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates and changes in probability assumptions with\\nrespect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria. Any changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration may have a material\\nimpact on our operating results.\\n \\nF-8\\x0cTable of Contents\\nNOTE 3.\\nSHARE CAPITAL:\\nOn November 21, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,475,000 shares of our common stock, at a price of $4.115 per share, and\\nwarrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,475,000 shares of our common stock, at a price of $0.01 per warrant. The warrants have a per share exercise\\nprice of $4.115, were exercisable as of November 21, 2017 and expire five years from that date. The gross proceeds to us from this offering were\\napproximately $6,084,375, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses.  In connection with the offering,\\nwe uplisted our common stock from the OTCQB Marketplace to trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “AMRH”, and we listed the\\npublicly offered warrants for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “AMRHW”.\\nOn January 24, 2018, we received confirmation from our transfer agent, Corporate Stock Transfer, Inc., which also serves as the warrant agent for\\nthe public warrant, that through such date certain holders of warrants had cumulatively exercised warrants for the purchase of a total of 153,060 shares of our\\n common stock, at an exercise price of $4.115 per share, for gross proceeds to us of $629,841.90.\\nNOTE 4.\\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS:\\nAcquisition of Ameri Georgia\\nOn November 20, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Bellsoft, Inc., a consulting company based in Lawrenceville, Georgia with over 175\\nconsultants specialized in the areas of SAP software, business intelligence, data warehousing and other enterprise resource planning services. Following the\\nacquisition, the name of Bellsoft, Inc. was changed to Ameri100 Georgia Inc. (“Ameri Georgia”). Ameri Georgia has operations in the United States, Canada\\nand India. For financial accounting purposes, we recognized September 1, 2015 as the effective date of the acquisition. The total consideration for the\\nacquisition of Ameri Georgia was $9.9 million, consisting of:\\n(a)\\nA cash payment in the amount of $3 million, which was paid at closing;\\n(b)\\n235,295 shares of our common stock issued at closing, valued at approximately $1million based on the closing price of our common stock\\non the closing date of the acquisition;\\n(c)\\n$0.25 million quarterly cash payments to be paid on the last day of each calendar quarter of 2016;\\n(d)\\nA $1 million cash reimbursement to be paid 5 days following closing to compensate Ameri Georgia for a portion of its approximate cash\\nbalance as of September 1, 2015;\\n(e)\\nApproximately $2.9 million paid within 30 days of closing in connection with the excess of Ameri Georgia’s accounts receivable over its\\naccounts payable as of September 1, 2015; and\\n(f)\\nEarn-out payments of approximately $0.5 million a year for 2016 and 2017, if earned through the achievement of annual revenue and\\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) targets specified in the purchase agreement, subject to downward\\nor upward adjustment depending on actual results. We estimate the earn-out payments to be earned at 100% of the targets set forth in the\\npurchase agreement.\\nThe valuation of Ameri Georgia was made on the basis of its projected revenues. The accounting acquisition date for Ameri Georgia was determined\\non the basis of the date when the Company acquired control of Ameri Georgia, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”)\\ncodification Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 805-10-25-6 for business combinations. That ASU provides that the date on which the acquirer obtains\\ncontrol of the acquiree generally is the date on which the acquirer legally transfers the consideration, acquires the assets, and assumes the liabilities of the\\nacquiree—the closing date. However, the acquirer might obtain control on a date that is either earlier or later than the closing date. For example, the\\nacquisition date precedes the closing date if a written agreement provides that the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree on a date before the closing date. An\\nacquirer shall consider all pertinent facts and circumstances in identifying the acquisition date.  The term sheet and the Share Purchase Agreement that were\\nentered into by the Company and Ameri Georgia contained agreements by the parties that the Company acquired control of Ameri Georgia’s accounts\\npayable, accounts receivable and business decisions as of September 1, 2015. In addition, on that date, the Company became responsible for performance of\\nAmeri Georgia’s existing contracts. Accordingly, the Company has recognized September 1, 2015 as the accounting acquisition date.\\n \\nF-9\\x0cTable of Contents\\nThe total purchase price of $9.9 million was allocated to net working capital of $4.6 million, intangibles of $1.8 million, taking into consideration\\nprojected revenue from the acquired list of Ameri Georgia customers over a period of three years, and goodwill. The excess of total purchase price over the\\nnet working capital and intangibles allocations has been allocated to goodwill.\\n \\nOn January 17, 2018, we completed all payment obligations to the former shareholders of Ameri Georgia in connection with the Ameri Georgia\\n share purchase agreement, and we have no further payment obligations pursuant thereto.\\nAcquisition of Bigtech Software Private Limited\\nOn June 23, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Bigtech Software Private Limited (“Bigtech”), a pure-play SAP services\\ncompany providing a wide range of SAP services including turnkey implementations, application management, training and basis ABAP support. Based in\\nBangalore, India, Bigtech offers SAP services to improve business operations at companies of all sizes and verticals. The acquisition of Bigtech was effective\\nas of July 1, 2016, and the total consideration for the acquisition of Bigtech was $0.85 million, consisting of:\\n(a)\\nA cash payment in the amount of $0.3 million which was due within 90 days of closing and was paid on September 22, 2016;\\n(b)\\nWarrants for the purchase of 51,000 shares of our common stock (valued at approximately $0.25 million based on the $6.51 closing price of\\nour common stock on the closing date of the acquisition), with such warrants exercisable for two years; and\\n(c)\\n$0.25 million, which may become payable in cash earn-outs to the sellers of Bigtech, if Bigtech achieves certain pre-determined revenue\\nand EBITDA targets in 2017 and 2018. We estimate the earn-out payments to be earned at 100% of the targets set forth in the purchase\\nagreement.\\nBigtech’s financial results are included in our condensed consolidated financial results starting July 1, 2016.  The Bigtech acquisition did not\\nconstitute a significant acquisition for the Company for purposes of Regulation S-X. The valuation of Bigtech was made on the basis of its projected\\nrevenues.\\nThe total purchase price of $0.85 million was allocated to intangibles of $0.6 million, taking into consideration projected revenue from the acquired\\nlist of Bigtech customers over a period of three years, and goodwill. The excess of total purchase price over the intangibles allocation has been allocated to\\ngoodwill. The Bigtech acquisition did not constitute a significant acquisition for the Company.\\nAcquisition of Virtuoso\\nOn July 22, 2016, we, through wholly-owned acquisition subsidiaries, acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of Virtuoso, L.L.C.\\n(“Virtuoso”), a Kansas limited liability company, pursuant to the terms of an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization, by and among us, Virtuoso\\nAcquisition Inc., Ameri100 Virtuoso Inc., Virtuoso and the sole member of Virtuoso (the “Sole Member”).

The Plan allows for the issuance of up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock for award grants. The Plan\\nprovides equity-based compensation through the grant of cash-based awards, nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights,\\nrestricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and other stock-based awards. We believe that an adequate reserve of shares\\navailable for issuance under the Plan is necessary to enable us to attract, motivate and retain key employees and directors and to provide an additional\\nincentive for such individuals through stock ownership and other rights that promote and recognize the financial success and growth of our Company. We\\ngranted options to purchase 285,000 shares of our common stock, 98,669 restricted stock units (“RSUs”), 28,600 shares of stock and 170,000 shares as bonus\\npursuant to the Plan with respect to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\\nDuring 2017, Lone Star Value Investors, LP exercised on a cashless exercise of warrant which resulted in the issuance of 1,205,837 shares of our\\ncommon stock and we recorded a corresponding charge to stock based compensation expense of $2.2 million, and 174,680 restricted stock units were\\ncancelled and an accelerated cost of $0.8 million due to such cancellation was accounted for as stock based compensation expense. The Company also\\naccelerated the vesting of 333,333 RSUs during 2017, which resulted in a charge of $1.1 million.\\nTotal share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and

Bank,\\nN.A. (as lender and as agent, “Sterling”). The Company joined Ameri California, Virtuoso and Ameri Arizona as borrowers under the Loan Agreement\\nfollowing their respective acquisition.\\nUnder the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers can borrow up to an aggregate of $10 million, which includes up to $8 million in principal for revolving\\nloans (the “Revolving Loans”) for general working capital purposes, up to $2 million in principal pursuant to a term loan (the “Term Loan”) for the purpose\\nof a permitted business acquisition and up to $200,000 for letters of credit. A portion of the proceeds of the Loan Agreement were also used to repay the\\nNovember 20, 2015 credit facility that was entered into between the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Ameri Georgia and Federal National Payables,\\nInc.\\nThe maturity of the loans under the Loan Agreement are as follows:\\nRevolving Loan Maturity Date: July 1, 2019; provided, however, that the Revolving Loan Maturity Date will extend and renew automatically for\\nsuccessive one-year terms on each anniversary of the initial Revolving Loan Maturity Date (each an “Anniversary Date”) thereafter, unless not less than sixty\\n(60) days prior to any such Anniversary Date, written notice of non-renewal is given by either party to the other, in which case the Revolving Loan Maturity\\nDate will be such next Anniversary Date.\\nTerm Loan Maturity Date: The earliest of (a) the date following acceleration of the Term Loan and/or the Revolving Loans; (b) the Revolving Loan\\nMaturity Date; or (c) July 1, 2019.\\nInterest under the Loan Agreement is payable monthly in arrears and accrues as follows:\\n \\n(a) in the case of Revolving Loans, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus (ii) 2.00%;\\n(b) in the case of the Term Loan, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus (ii) 3.75%; and\\n(c) in the case of other obligations of the Borrowers, a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (A) 3.25% or (B) Wall Street Journal\\nPrime Rate plus (ii) 3.75%.\\nThe Loan Agreement also requires the payment of certain fees, including, but not limited to letter of credit fees and an unused Revolving Loans fee.\\nThe Loan Agreement contains financial and other covenant requirements, including, but not limited to, financial covenants that require the\\nBorrowers to not permit capital expenditures above $150,000 in any fiscal year, maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00 and\\nmaintain certain debt to EBITDA ratios. The Loan Agreement also requires the Company and Borrowers to obtain Sterling’s consent before making any\\npermitted acquisitions. The amounts borrowed by the Borrowers under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed by the guarantors, and the Loan Agreement is\\nsecured by substantially all of the Borrowers’ assets.\\nThe principal amount of the Term Loan will be repaid as follows: (i) equal consecutive monthly installments in the amount of $33,333.33 each, paid\\non the first day of each calendar month and (ii) one final payment of the entire remaining principal balance, together with all accrued unpaid interest on the\\nTerm Loan maturity date.\\nOn August 28, 2017, pursuant to an amendment of the Loan Agreement, we and certain of our subsidiaries obtained an incremental term loan from\\nSterling National Bank in the amount of $343,200.58, which amount was an addition to and comprised a part of the existing Term Loan under the existing\\nLoan Agreement. In January 2018, we repaid the incremental term loan.\\nTo date, we are not in compliance with the financial covenants contained in its Loan Agreement with Sterling National Bank. We received waivers\\nfrom Sterling National Bank for our non-compliance with the Loan Agreement for the quarters ended March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017\\nand December 31, 2017 in exchange for the payment of a fee of $5,000 for each quarterly waiver. We do not expect Sterling National Bank to continue to\\ngrant further waivers for continued non-compliance.\\n \\nF-16\\x0cTable of Contents\\nIf we are not in compliance with the Loan Agreement in the future and we are unable to obtain future waivers from Sterling National Bank, the bank\\ncould declare our loans with it to be in default and elect to claim all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments\\nto extend further credit. If we are unable to repay the outstanding amounts, Sterling National Bank could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure\\nour indebtedness to it. We pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement is also supported by a validity\\nguaranty from our former Chief Executive Officer. If Sterling National Bank accelerates the repayment of our loans, there is no assurance that we will have\\nsufficient assets to repay the loans. A default under the Loan Agreement may also result in an event of default under the 2017 Notes. We are currently looking\\nfor additional sources of financing, however there is no guarantee that we will have additional financing available to us.\\nInterest paid on the Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $0.15 million. Principal repaid on the Term Loan during the\\nyear ended December 31, 2017 was $0.4 million. The short term and long-term outstanding balances on the Term Loan as of December 31, 2017 was $0.7\\nmillion and $1.1 million, respectively. The outstanding balance of the Revolving Loans as of December 31, 2017 was $3.7 million.\\nBigtech, which was acquired as of July 1, 2016, had a term loan of $0.01 million and a line of credit for $0.36 million as of December 31, 2017. The\\nBigtech line of credit is with an Indian bank, HDFC Bank Limited, and was entered into on September 3, 2015 for Bigtech’s working capital requirements.\\nThe line of credit is for up to $0.4 million with an interest rate of 11.85% per annum and maturity in June 2020. The Bigtech term loan accrues interest at the\\nrate of 10.30% per annum and matures in 2020. Both the term loan and the line of credit were already in place when the Company acquired Bigtech. Interest\\npaid during the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $2,015 for the term loan and $37,719 line of credit held by Bigtech.\\nIn addition, we have an outstanding aggregate of $1.25 million in 8% Convertible Unsecured Promissory Notes (the “2017 Notes”), which were\\nissued to four accredited investors, including one of the Company’s then-directors, Dhruwa N. Rai, and David Luci, who became a director of the Company in\\nFebruary 2018. The 2017 Notes bear interest at 8% per annum until maturity in March 2020, with interest being paid annually on the first, second and third\\nanniversaries of the issuance of the 2017 Notes beginning in March 2018. From and after an event of default and for so long as the event of default is\\ncontinuing, the 2017 Notes will bear default interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The 2017 Notes can be prepaid by us at any time without penalty. As of\\nMarch 29, 2018, we are not current in the payment of interest on all of the 2017 Notes and are in discussion with holders of the 2017 notes for which we are\\nnot current in the payment of interest to negotiate longer payment terms until we are able to raise more capital.\\nThe 2017 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $2.80. The holders of the 2017 Notes have the right,\\nat their option, at any time and from time to time to convert, in part or in whole, the outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest under\\nthe 2017 Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock at the then applicable conversion price.\\nThe 2017 Notes rank junior to our secured credit facility with Sterling National Bank. The 2017 Notes also include certain negative covenants\\nincluding, without the investors’ approval, restrictions on dividends and other restricted payments and reclassification of its stock.\\nOn March 10, 2017, we issued as consideration to the selling stockholders of Ameri California unsecured promissory notes issued for the aggregate\\nprincipal amount of $3,750,000 (which notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum and mature on June 30, 2018).  On February 28, 2018, we entered the\\nAmendment with Moneta Ventures Fund I, L.P. to amend the terms of the Moneta Note. Among other things, the Amendment provided for the extension of\\nthe maturity of the Moneta Note to August 31, 2018, amendment of the payment terms of the Moneta Note, waiver by Moneta of the existence of any\\nCompany event of default pursuant to the Moneta Note as of February 28, 2018 and waiver by the Company of certain restrictions with respect to the resale\\nof certain restricted common stock of the Company held by Moneta.\\nShort-term Debt:\\n \\nThe following summarizes our short-term debt balances as of December 31:\\n \\n \\n2017\\n  \\n2016\\n \\nNotes outstanding under revolving credit facility\\n $\\n4,053,318  $\\n3,088,890 \\nTerm loan - current maturities\\n  \\n749,551   \\n405,376 \\nTotal short-term debt\\n $\\n4,802,869  $\\n3,494,266 \\n \\nF-17\\x0cTable of Contents\\nLong-term Debt:\\n \\nThe following summarizes our long-term debt balances as of December 31:\\n \\n \\n2017\\n  \\n2016\\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\nTerm loan, due 2019\\n $\\n1,880,114  $\\n1,941,567 \\nLess:  Current maturities\\n  \\n749,551   \\n405,376 \\nLong-term debt, net of current maturities\\n $\\n1,130,563  $\\n1,536,191 \\nThe following represents the schedule of maturities of our long-term debt:\\nYear\\n \\nAmounts\\n \\n2018\\n  \\n749,551 \\n2019\\n  \\n1,130,563 \\n Total\\n $\\n1,880,114 \\nNOTE 13.\\nACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES:\\nAccrued expense and other liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 consisted of the following:\\n \\n December 31, 2017   December 31, 2016  \\nSalaries, commissions and other benefits payable\\n  \\n1,156,601   \\n564,244 \\nProfessional and legal fees payable\\n  \\n329,332   \\n507,657 \\nInterest payable\\n  \\n262,520   \\n- \\nTaxes Payable\\n  \\n446,694   \\n525,766 \\nOther liabilities\\n  \\n387,514   \\n567,421 \\nTOTAL\\n  \\n2,582,661   \\n2,165,088 \\n \\nNOTE 14.\\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN:\\nThe Company has a 401(k)-tax deferred savings plan (the “401(k) Plan”) that is available to all employees who satisfy certain minimum hour\\nrequirements each year.

The effective tax rates reflected our combined federal and state income tax rates and the recognition of U.S. deferred tax liabilities for\\ndifferences between the book and tax basis of goodwill.\\nWe assess the reliability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis. The periodic assessment of the\\nnet carrying value of our deferred tax assets under the applicable accounting rules is highly judgmental. We are required to consider all available positive and\\nnegative evidence in evaluating the likelihood that we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in the future. Such evidence includes\\nscheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and the results of recent operations. Since this\\nevaluation requires consideration of events that may occur some years into the future, there is significant judgment involved and our conclusion could be\\nmaterially different should certain of our expectations not transpire.\\nWe have reviewed the tax positions taken, or to be taken, in our tax returns for all tax years currently open to examination by a taxing authority. As\\nof December 31, 2017, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits exclusive of interest and penalties was zero. We have identified no other uncertain tax\\npositions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the twelve months\\n ending December 31, 2018. We remain subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for each respective tax jurisdiction.\\nNOTE 16.\\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\\nOperating Leases\\nThe Company’s principal facility is located in Princeton, New Jersey. The Company also leases office space in various locations with expiration\\ndates between 2016 and 2020. The lease agreements often include leasehold improvement incentives, escalating lease payments, renewal provisions and other\\nprovisions which require the Company to pay taxes, insurance, maintenance costs, or defined rent increases. All of the Company’s leases are accounted for as\\noperating leases. Rent expense is recorded over the lease terms on a straight-line basis. Rent expense was $0.34 million and $0.22 million for the twelve\\nmonths ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\\nThe Company has entered into an operating lease for its primary office facility in Princeton, New Jersey, which expires in July 2019. The future\\nminimum rental payments under these lease agreements are as follows:\\n \\n \\nYears ending\\nDecember 31,\\n \\n2018\\n  \\n123,873 \\n2019\\n  \\n67,415 \\n2020\\n  \\n70,333 \\n2021\\n  \\n7,371 \\nTotal\\n $\\n268,992 \\n \\nNOTE 17.\\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT:\\nWe utilize the following valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs\\ninto three broad levels as follows:\\n \\n·\\nLevel 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\\n \\nF-19\\x0cTable of Contents\\n·\\nLevel 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly\\nor indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and\\n \\n·\\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.\\nA financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\\nmeasurement.\\nThe following table sets forth the financial assets, measured at fair value, by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2017:\\n \\n \\nLevel 1\\n  \\nLevel 2\\n  \\nLevel 3\\n  \\nTotal\\n \\nCash equivalents:\\n $\\n-  $\\n-  $\\n-  $\\n- \\nContingent consideration\\n  \\n-   \\n-   \\n3,374,660   \\n3,374,660 \\nTotal\\n  \\n-   \\n-  $\\n3,374,660  $\\n3,374,660 \\nThe following table sets forth the financial assets, measured at fair value, by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2016:\\n \\n \\nLevel 1\\n  \\nLevel 2\\n  \\nLevel 3\\n  \\nTotal\\n \\nCash equivalents:\\n $\\n-  $\\n-  $\\n-  $\\n- \\nContingent consideration\\n  \\n-   \\n-   \\n5,266,488   \\n5,266,488 \\nTotal\\n  \\n-   \\n-  $\\n5,266,488  $\\n5,266,488 \\nThe following table presents the change in level 3 instruments:\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nOpening balance December 31st 2016\\n  \\n5,266,488 \\nAdditions during the period\\n $\\n1,200,000 \\nPaid/settlements\\n  \\n(2,017,670)\\nTotal gains recognized in Statement of Operations\\n  \\n(1,074,158)\\nClosing balance December 31st 2017\\n $\\n3,374,660 \\nContingent consideration pertaining to the acquisitions referred to in Note 4 above as of December 31, 2017 has been classified under Level 3 as the\\nfair valuation of such contingent consideration has been done using one or more of the significant inputs which are not based on observable market data.\\nThe fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using a discounted cash flow technique with significant inputs that are not observable in\\nthe market. The significant inputs not supported by market activity included our probability assessments of expected future cash flows related to the\\nacquisitions during the earn-out period, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligation, and calculated in accordance\\nwith the respective terms of the share purchase agreements.\\nThe amount of total gains/(losses) included in our Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income/(Loss) is attributable to change in fair value\\nof contingent consideration arising from our earlier acquisitions were $1.1 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016,\\nrespectively.\\nNo financial instruments were transferred into or out of Level 3 classification during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\\nNOTE 18.\\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\\n \\nThe Company takes the position that all of its businesses operate as a single segment.
