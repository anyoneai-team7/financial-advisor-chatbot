The Company \\ndoes not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by law. \\n \\n \\n2\\x0c \\n \\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\nPART I \\nITEM 1 \\nBUSINESS \\nGeneral \\nGencor Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company,” “Gencor,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading manufacturer \\nof heavy machinery used in the production of highway construction equipment and materials and environmental control \\nequipment.   The Company’s products are manufactured in the United States and sold through a combination of \\nCompany sales representatives and independent dealers and agents located throughout the world.  \\nThe Company designs, manufactures and sells machinery and related equipment used primarily for the production of \\nasphalt and highway construction equipment and materials. The Company’s principal core products include asphalt \\npavers, hot mix asphalt plants, combustion systems, and fluid heat transfer systems. The Company believes that its \\ntechnical and design capabilities and environmentally friendly process technology have enabled it to become a leading \\nproducer of hot mix asphalt plants and related components in North America. The Company believes it has the largest \\ninstalled base of asphalt plants in the United States. \\nBecause the Company’s products are sold primarily to companies in the highway construction industry, its business has \\nhistorically been seasonal. Traditionally, the Company’s customers do not purchase new equipment during the summer \\nand fall months to avoid disrupting their peak season for highway construction and repair work. The majority of orders \\nfor the Company’s asphalt plants and pavers are typically received between October and February, with a significant \\nvolume of shipments occurring prior to June.  The principal factors driving demand for the Company’s products are the \\nlevel of federal and state funding for domestic highway construction and repair, the replacement of existing plants, and a \\ntrend towards efficient, larger plants.  \\nIn 1968, the Company was formed by the merger of Mechtron Corporation with General Combustion, Inc. (“General \\nCombustion”) and Genco Manufacturing, Inc.  The new entity reincorporated in Delaware in 1969 and adopted the \\nname Mechtron International Corporation in 1970.  In 1985, the Company began a series of acquisitions into related \\nfields starting with the Beverley Group Ltd. (“Beverley”) in the United Kingdom.  Hy-Way Heat Company, Inc. (“Hy-\\nWay Heat”) and the Bituma Group were acquired in 1986.  In 1987, the Company changed its name to Gencor \\n Industries, Inc. and acquired Davis Line Inc. and its subsidiaries in 1988. \\nIn 1998, the Company entered into agreements with Carbontronics, LLC, pursuant to which the Company designed, \\nmanufactured, sold and installed four synthetic fuel production plants. In addition to payment for the plants, the \\nCompany received membership interests in two synthetic fuel entities. These derived significant cash flows from the \\nsale of synthetic fuel and tax credits (Internal Revenue Code, Section 29) and, consequently, distributed significant cash \\n to the Company from 2001 to 2010. \\nThe tax credit legislation expired at the end of calendar year 2007.  Consequently, the four synthetic fuel plants were \\ndecommissioned.  The plants were sold or transferred to site owners in exchange for a release of all contracted liabilities \\n related to the removal of plants from the sites.  Gencor’s ownership in the two synthetic fuel entities ended in 2013.   \\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company acquired the Blaw-Knox assets from Volvo Construction Equipment North America, \\nLLC (“Volvo CE”).  The acquisition expanded the Company’s product offerings by adding highway class asphalt \\npavers to its asphalt plant and related equipment products.  \\nProducts \\nAsphalt Plants. The Company manufactures and produces hot-mix asphalt plants used in the production of asphalt \\npaving materials. The Company also manufactures related asphalt plant equipment, including hot-mix storage silos, \\nfabric filtration systems, cold feed bins and other plant components. The Company’s H&B (Hetherington and Berner) \\nproduct line is the world’s oldest asphalt plant line, first manufactured in 1894. The Company’s subsidiary, Bituma \\nCorporation, formerly known as Boeing Construction Company, developed the first continuous process for asphalt \\n3\\x0c \\n \\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\nproduction. Gencor developed and patented the first counter flow drum mix technology, several adaptations of which \\nhave become the industry standard, which recaptures and burns emissions and vapors, resulting in a cleaner and more \\nefficient process. The Company also manufactures a very comprehensive range of fully mobile batch plants. \\nCombustion Systems and Industrial Incinerators. The Company manufactures combustion systems, which are large \\nburners that can transform most solid, liquid or gaseous fuels into usable energy, or burn multiple fuels, alternately or \\nsimultaneously. Through its subsidiary General Combustion, the Company has been a significant source of combustion \\nsystems for the asphalt and aggregate drying industries since the 1950’s. The Company also manufactures combustion \\nsystems for rotary dryers, kilns, fume and liquid incinerators and fuel heaters. The Company believes maintenance and \\nfuel costs are lower for its burners because of their superior design. \\nFluid Heat Transfer Systems. The Company’s General Combustion subsidiary manufactures the Hy-Way Heat and \\nBeverley lines of thermal fluid heat transfer systems and specialty storage tanks for a wide array of industry uses. \\nThermal fluid heat transfer systems are similar to boilers, but use high temperature oil instead of water. Thermal fluid \\nheaters have been replacing steam pressure boilers as the best method of heat transfer for storage, heating and pumping \\nviscous materials (i.e., asphalt, chemicals, heavy oils, etc.) in many industrial and petrochemical applications \\nworldwide. The Company believes the high-efficiency design of its thermal fluid heaters can outperform competitive \\nunits in many types of process applications.  \\nAsphalt Pavers.  The Company manufactures asphalt pavers under the Blaw-Knox brand.  The Blaw-Knox brand dates \\nback over a century, when in 1917 Blaw Collapsible Steel Centering Company merged with the Knox Pressed and \\nWelded Steel Company. Blaw-Knox made its first road paving equipment in 1929. Blaw-Knox pavers are the industry \\nleading, highway class pavers that deliver outstanding reliability and produce the highest quality rideable surfaces in the \\nindustry. Projects paved with Blaw-Knox pavers continually win industry awards for the highest quality highway \\npavements.  \\nProduct Engineering and Development \\nThe Company is engaged in product engineering and development efforts to expand its product lines and to further \\ndevelop more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly equipment. \\nProduct engineering and development activities are directed toward more efficient methods of producing asphalt and \\nlower cost fluid heat transfer systems. In addition, efforts are also focused on developing combustion systems that \\noperate at higher efficiency and offer a higher level of environmental compatibility.   \\nSources of Supply and Manufacturing \\nSubstantially all products and components sold by the Company and its subsidiaries are manufactured and assembled by \\nthe Company. The Company purchases steel, other raw materials and hardware used to manufacture its products from \\nnumerous suppliers. The Company may augment internal production by outsourcing some of its production when \\ndemand for its products exceeds its manufacturing capacity. \\nSeasonality \\nThe Company is concentrated in the manufacturing of asphalt pavers, asphalt plants and related components, which is \\ntypically subject to a seasonal slow-down during the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year.  \\nCompetition \\nThe markets for the Company’s products are highly competitive. The industry remains fairly concentrated, with a small \\nnumber of companies competing for the majority of the Company’s product lines. The principal competitive factors \\ninclude quality, price, delivery, availability, and technology. The Company believes it manufactures the highest quality \\nand heaviest equipment in the industry. Its products’ performance reliability, brand recognition, pricing, and after-the-\\nsale technical support are other important factors.  \\n4\\x0c \\n \\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\nSales and Marketing \\nThe Company’s products and services are marketed primarily through Company-employed sales representatives and \\nindependent dealers. \\nSales Backlog \\nThe size of the Company’s backlog should not be viewed as an indicator of the Company’s quarterly or annualized \\nrevenues, due to the timing of order fulfillment of asphalt plants.  The Company’s backlog, which includes orders \\nreceived through the date of this filing, was $53.1 million and $24.9 million as of December 1, 2021 and December 1, \\n2020, respectively. \\nFinancial Information about Geographic Areas Reporting Segments \\nFor a geographic breakdown of revenues and long-term assets, see Reporting Segments and Geographic Areas in Note 1 \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements.   \\nLicenses, Patents and Trademarks \\nThe Company holds numerous patents covering technology and applications related to various products, equipment and \\nsystems, and numerous trademarks and trade names registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in various \\nforeign countries. In general, the Company depends upon technological capabilities, manufacturing quality control and \\napplication know-how, rather than patents or other proprietary rights in the conduct of its business.  \\nGovernment Regulations \\nThe Company believes its design and manufacturing processes meet all industry and governmental agency standards \\nthat may apply to its entire line of products, including all domestic and foreign environmental, structural, electrical and \\nsafety codes. The Company’s products are designed and manufactured to comply with U.S. Environmental Protection \\nAgency regulations. Certain state and local regulatory authorities have strong environmental impact regulations. While \\nthe Company believes that such regulations have helped, rather than restricted its marketing efforts and sales results, \\nthere is no assurance that changes to federal, state, local, or foreign laws and regulations will not have a material \\nadverse effect on the Company’s products and earnings in the future. \\nEnvironmental Matters \\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the \\nenvironment.  The Company believes it is in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. The \\nCompany does not expect any material impact on future operating costs as a result of compliance with currently enacted \\nenvironmental regulations. \\nEmployees \\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company had 380 full-time employees. The Company has a collective bargaining \\nagreement covering employees at its Marquette, Iowa facility. No other employees are represented by a labor union or \\ncollective bargaining agreement.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nAvailable Information  \\nFor further discussion concerning the Company’s business, see the information included in Item 7 (Management’s \\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Item 8 (Financial Statements and \\nSupplementary Data) of this Annual Report.  \\nThe Company makes available free of charge through its website at www.gencor.com the Company’s Annual Reports \\non Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports, if \\napplicable, filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably \\npracticable after the material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission \\n (“SEC”). The information posted on the website is not incorporated into this Annual Report.  \\n \\n5\\x0c \\n \\n \\n7 \\n \\n \\n ITEM 1A \\nRISK FACTORS \\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered.  The \\nrisks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces.  Additional risks and uncertainties not \\npresently known to the Company, or that the Company presently deems less significant, may also impair the Company’s \\noperations.  If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company’s business operating results and financial \\ncondition could be materially adversely affected. The order of these risk factors does not reflect their relative \\n  importance or likelihood of occurrence. \\nThe business is affected by the cyclical nature of the markets it serves.   \\nThe demand for the Company’s products is dependent on general economic conditions and more specifically, Federal \\nand state funding for highways and roads.  Adverse economic conditions may cause customers to forego or delay new \\n purchases and rely more on repairing existing equipment thus negatively impacting the Company’s sales and profits.  \\nThe business is affected by the level of government funding for highway construction in the United States and \\nCanada.   \\nMost highway contractors in the U.S. and Canada depend on funding by federal, provincial, state and local agencies for \\nhighway, transit and infrastructure programs.  Future legislation may increase or decrease government spending, which, \\nif decreased, could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Federal and/or \\n state funding allocated to infrastructure may decrease in the future. \\nPreviously, the Company depended on one customer for a significant portion of its revenue.  The loss of any \\nrelationship with a large customer, or a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of any such \\ncustomer, could have adverse consequences on the Company’s future business.  \\nNo customer accounted for 10% or more of fiscal 2021 or 2020 revenues. If the Company had customers that accounted \\nfor a significant portion of its net revenues, then the loss of any of those customers, or a significant reduction in sales to \\n any such customer, could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and, consequently, its business. \\nIf the Company fails to comply with requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting under \\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the business could be harmed and its stock price could decline.  \\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require the Company to assess its \\ninternal control over financial reporting annually. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to \\nassess its internal control over financial reporting are complex. They require significant documentation, testing, and \\npossible remediation of any significant deficiencies in and/or material weaknesses of internal controls in order to meet \\nthe detailed standards under these rules. The Company has evaluated its internal control over financial reporting as \\neffective as of September 30, 2021. See Item 9A – Controls and Procedures – Management’s Annual Report on Internal \\nControl over Financial Reporting. Although the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting \\nwas effective as of September 30, 2021, in future fiscal years, the Company may encounter unanticipated delays or \\nproblems in assessing its internal control over financial reporting as effective or in completing its assessments by the \\nrequired dates. In addition, the Company cannot be assured that, if required, its independent registered public \\naccountants will attest that internal control over financial reporting is effective in future fiscal years. If the Company \\ncannot assess its internal control over financial reporting as effective, investor confidence and share value may be \\n negatively impacted.  \\nThe Company may be required to reduce its profit margins on contracts where revenues are recognized over time.  \\nRevenues from contracts with customers for the design, manufacture and sale of custom equipment are recognized over \\ntime when the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the equipment. Control of the equipment \\ntransfers over time as the equipment is unique to the specific contract and thus does not create an asset with an \\nalternative use. Revenues and costs are recognized in proportion to actual labor costs incurred, as compared with total \\n6\\x0c \\n \\n \\n8 \\n \\n \\nestimated labor costs expected to be incurred during the entire contract. As a result, revisions made to the estimates of \\nrevenues and profits are recorded in the period in which the conditions that require such revisions become known and \\ncan be estimated. Although the Company believes that its profit margins are fairly stated and that adequate provisions \\nfor losses for its fixed-price contracts are recorded in the financial statements, as required by accounting principles \\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company cannot assure that its estimated contract \\n profit margins will not decrease or its estimated loss provisions will not increase materially in the future.  \\nThe Company may encounter difficulties with acquisitions.  \\nAs part of its growth strategy, the Company intends to evaluate the acquisition of other companies, assets or product \\nlines that would complement or expand the Company’s existing business or broaden its customer base. Although the \\nCompany conducts due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates, it may not be able to identify all material \\nliabilities or risks related to potential acquisition candidates. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to \\nlocate and acquire any business, retain key personnel and customers of an acquired business or integrate any acquired \\nbusiness successfully. Additionally, there can be no assurance that financing for any acquisition, if necessary, will be \\navailable on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the Company will be able to accomplish its strategic objectives in \\n connection with any acquisition.  \\nThe Company’s marketable securities are comprised of cash and money funds, equities, corporate bonds, mutual \\nfunds, exchange-traded funds, and government securities invested through professional investment management \\nfirms and are subject to various risks, such as interest rates, markets, and credit.   \\nDue to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in \\nthe value of securities, changes in these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of \\n operations. \\nThere are and will continue to be quarterly fluctuations of the Company’s operating results.  \\nThe Company’s operating results historically have fluctuated from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors, \\nincluding the value, timing and shipment of individual orders and the mix of products sold. Revenues from contracts \\nwith customers for the design, manufacture and sale of custom equipment are recognized over time when the \\nperformance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the equipment. Revenues from all other contracts for the \\ndesign and manufacture of equipment, for service and for parts sales, net of any discounts and return allowances, are \\nrecorded at a point in time when control of the goods or services has been transferred. The Company’s asphalt \\nproduction equipment operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which may lower revenues and result in possible \\n quarterly operating losses.  \\nIf the Company is unable to attract and retain key personnel, its business could be adversely affected.  \\nThe success of the Company will continue to depend substantially upon the efforts, abilities and services of its \\nmanagement team and certain other key employees. The loss of one or more key employees could adversely affect the \\nCompany’s operations. The Company’s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, either through direct hiring, or \\nacquisition of other businesses employing such persons, will also be an important factor in determining its future \\n success.  \\nThe Company may be required to defend its intellectual property against infringement or against infringement \\nclaims of others.  \\nThe Company holds numerous patents covering technology and applications related to various products, equipment and \\nsystems, and numerous trademarks and trade names registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in various \\nforeign countries. There can be no assurance as to the breadth or degree of protection that future patents or trademarks \\nmay afford the Company, or that any pending patent or trademark applications will result in issued patents or \\ntrademarks, or that the Company’s patents, registered trademarks or patent applications, if any, will be upheld if \\nchallenged, or that competitors will not develop similar or superior methods or products outside the protection of any \\n7\\x0c \\n \\n \\n9 \\n \\n \\npatents issued, licensed or sublicensed to the Company. Although the Company believes that none of its technologies, \\nproducts or trademarks infringe upon the patents, technologies, products or trademarks of others, it is possible that the \\nCompany’s trademarks or other rights may not be valid or that infringement of future patents, trademarks or proprietary \\nrights may occur. In the event that the Company’s products are deemed to infringe upon the patent or proprietary rights \\nof others, the Company could be required to modify the design of its products, change the name of its products or obtain \\na license for the use of certain technologies incorporated into its products. There can be no assurance that the Company \\nwould be able to do any of the foregoing in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all, and the \\nfailure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that the \\nCompany will have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent, registered trademark or \\nother proprietary right, and, if the Company’s products are deemed to infringe upon the patents, trademarks or other \\nproprietary rights of others, the Company could become liable for damages, which could also have a material adverse \\n effect on the Company.  \\nThe Company may be subject to substantial liability for its products.  \\nThe Company is engaged in a business that could expose it to possible liability claims for personal injury or property \\ndamage due to alleged design or manufacturing defects in its products. The Company believes that it meets existing \\nprofessional specification standards recognized or required in the industries in which it operates, and there are no \\nmaterial product liability claims pending against the Company as of the date hereof. Although the Company currently \\nmaintains product liability coverage, which it believes is adequate for the continued operation of its business, such \\ninsurance may prove inadequate or become difficult to obtain or unobtainable in the future on terms acceptable to the \\n Company.  \\nThe Company is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, and the costs related to compliance with, \\nor the Company’s failure to comply with, existing or future laws and regulations, could adversely affect the business \\nand results of operations.  \\nThe Company’s operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection \\nof the environment. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, \\nsignificant administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The Company’s business involves environmental \\nmanagement and issues typically associated with historical manufacturing operations. To date, the Company’s cost of \\ncomplying with environmental laws and regulations has not been material, but the fact that such laws or regulations are \\nchanged frequently makes predicting the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on the Company’s future \\n operations uncertain.  \\nThe Company is dependent upon third-party suppliers, making it vulnerable to supply shortages and price increases. \\nThe principal raw material the Company uses is carbon steel which is sourced through numerous suppliers. The \\nCompany also uses select suppliers to provide proprietary components to its finished products. Although the Company \\nbelieves that raw materials are available from alternate sources, an interruption in the supply of steel or related \\nproducts or a substantial increase in the price of steel or related products could have a material adverse effect on the \\nCompany’s production and its results of operations. \\nIn addition, the cost of parts or materials may increase significantly for reasons other than changes in commodity prices. \\nFactors such as supply and demand, freight costs, availability of transportation, availability of labor, inventory levels, \\nthe level of imports, the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and general economic conditions may \\naffect the price of our parts or materials. Market conditions could limit the Company’s ability to raise selling prices to \\noffset increases in material and/or labor costs. \\nIn the future, we could experience some disruption in the supply of some of our parts or materials that we purchase from \\nsuppliers. Delays in obtaining parts or materials may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers including \\ncapacity constraints, labor shortages or supplier product quality issues. These risks are increased in a weak economic \\nenvironment or when demand increases coming out of an economic downturn. Such disruptions could result in \\n8\\x0c \\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\n \\nmanufacturing inefficiencies caused by the Company having to wait for parts to arrive on production lines, could delay \\nsales and could result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, and/or \\n cash flows. \\nThe Company is subject to government regulations.  \\nThe Company is committed to responsible environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices. The Company \\nstrives to be recognized as a company that achieves customer expectations safely and in a manner that rewards both its \\ncustomers and its employees. The Company strives to achieve these goals through an organizational structure that \\nprovides excellent service and a reputation of integrity with the communities where it operates while providing its \\n employees with growth opportunities in an injury-free environment.  \\nThe Company is subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing of its products. Failure \\nby the Company to comply with regulations could subject it to liabilities, or suspension of production that could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s results. Such regulations could also restrict the Company’s ability to expand \\nits facilities, or to incur other expenses to comply with such regulations. Although the Company believes it has the \\ndesign and manufacturing capability to meet all industry or governmental agency standards that may apply to its product \\nlines, including all domestic and foreign environmental, structural, electrical and safety codes, there can be no assurance \\nthat governmental laws and regulations will not become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs \\nand increasing risks and penalties associated with a violation. The cost to the Company of such compliance to date has \\nnot materially affected its business, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however, \\nthat violations will not occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. The Company’s \\ncustomers are also subject to extensive regulations, including those related to the workplace. The Company cannot \\npredict the nature, scope or effect of governmental legislation, or regulatory requirements that could be imposed or how \\nexisting or future laws or regulations will be administered, or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or \\nregulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial \\n expenditures by the Company and could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.  \\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the Company’s ESG practices may \\nexpose us to new or additional risks. \\nCompanies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their ESG practices.  \\nInvestor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also \\nincreasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and \\nsocial cost of their investments.  Regardless of the industry, investors’ and stakeholders’ increased focus related to \\nstakeholder ESG expectations and standards, which are evolving, may cause the Company to suffer from reputational \\ndamage and its business or financial condition could be adversely affected. \\nThe Company’s management has effective voting control.  \\nThe Company’s officers beneficially own 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Class B stock. The holders \\nof the Class B stock are entitled to elect 75% (calculated to the nearest whole number, rounding five-tenths to next \\nhighest whole number) of the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Further, approval of a majority of the \\nholders of the Class B stock is generally required to affect a sale of the Company and certain other corporate \\ntransactions. As a result, the Class B shareholders can elect more than a majority of the Board of Directors and exercise \\nsignificant influence over most matters requiring approval by the Company’s shareholders. This concentration of \\n control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.  \\nThe issuance of preferred stock may impede a change of control or may be dilutive to existing shareholders.  \\nThe Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes the Company’s Board of Directors, without \\nshareholder vote, to issue up to 300,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to determine for any series \\nthe dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other preferences, rights and terms that are senior, and not available, to \\n9\\x0c \\n \\n \\n11 \\n \\n \\nthe holders of the Company’s common stock. Thus, issuances of series of preferred stock could adversely affect the \\nrelative voting power, distributions and other rights of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could deter or \\nimpede a merger, tender offer or other transaction that some, or a majority of the Company’s common shareholders \\nmight believe to be in their best interest or in which the Company’s common shareholders might receive a premium for \\n their shares over the then current market price of such shares. \\nThe Company may be required to indemnify its directors and executive officers.  \\nThe Company has authority under Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law to indemnify its directors and \\nofficers to the extent provided in that statute. The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, provides that a \\ndirector shall not be personally liable to the Company for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent \\nsuch exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law. The \\nCompany’s Bylaws provide, in part, that it indemnify each of its directors and officers against liabilities imposed upon \\nthem (including reasonable amounts paid in settlement) and expenses incurred by them in connection with any claim \\nmade against them or any action, suit or proceeding to which they may be a party by reason of their being or having \\nbeen a director or officer. The Company maintains officers’ and directors’ liability insurance coverage. There can be no \\nassurance that such insurance will be available in the future, or that if available, it will be available on terms that are \\nacceptable to the Company. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage provided will be \\nsufficient to cover the amount of any judgment awarded against an officer or director (either individually or in the \\naggregate). Consequently, if such judgment exceeds the coverage under the policy, the Company may be forced to pay \\n such difference.  \\nThe Company enters into indemnification agreements with each of its executive officers and directors containing \\nprovisions that may require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may \\narise by reason of their status or service as officers or directors (other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of \\na culpable nature) and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they \\ncould be indemnified. Management believes that such indemnification provisions and agreements are necessary to \\n attract and retain qualified persons as directors and executive officers.  \\nThe Company does not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.  \\nThe Company intends to retain its cash to fund its business requirements. It does not anticipate paying cash dividends on \\nits common stock or Class B stock. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the \\nCompany’s Board of Directors and will be dependent upon existing conditions, including the financial condition and \\nresults of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects, and other factors that the Board \\n of Directors considers relevant.  \\nCompetition could reduce revenue from the Company’s products and services and cause it to lose market share. \\nThe Company currently faces strong competition in product performance, price and service.  Some of the Company’s \\ncompetitors have greater financial, product development and marketing resources than the Company.  If competition in \\nthe Company’s industry intensifies or if the current competitors enhance their products or lower their prices for \\ncompeting products, the Company may lose sales or be required to lower the prices it charges for its products.  This may \\nreduce revenues from the Company’s products and services, lower its gross margins, or cause a loss in market share.  \\n \\nThe Company’s quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate, which may decrease its stock price. \\nThe Company’s quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly from \\nquarter to quarter in the future.  As a result, the Company’s operating results may fall below the expectations of \\nsecurities analysts and investors in some quarters, which could result in a decrease in the market price of its common \\nstock.  The reasons the Company’s quarterly results may fluctuate include: \\n• \\nGeneral competitive and economic conditions; \\n10\\x0c \\n \\n \\n12 \\n \\n \\n• \\nDelays in, or uneven timing in, delivery of customer orders; \\n• \\nThe seasonal nature of the industry; \\n• \\nThe fluctuations in the market value of its securities portfolio; \\n• \\nThe introduction of new products by the Company or its competitors; \\n• \\nProduct supply shortages; \\n• \\nReduced demand due to adverse weather conditions; \\n• \\nExpiration or renewal of Federal highway programs; and \\n• \\nChanges to federal, state or Canadian provincial programs. \\n  \\n Period-to-period comparisons of such items should not be relied on as indications of future performance. \\nThe Company’s common stock has been, and likely will continue to be, subject to substantial price and volume \\nfluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which will be beyond the Company’s control.  \\nThe market price of the Company’s common stock may be significantly affected by various factors, such as:  \\n• \\nQuarterly variations in operating results; \\n• \\nChanges in revenue growth rates as a whole or for specific geographic areas or products; \\n• \\nChanges in earnings estimates by market analysts; \\n• \\nThe announcement of new products or product enhancements by the Company or its competitors; \\n• \\nSpeculation in the press or analyst community of potential acquisitions by the Company; and \\n• \\n General market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries.  \\nThe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and the stock price of its common \\nstock could be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nThe Company’s business, results of operations financial condition, cash flows, and the stock price of its common stock \\ncan be adversely affected by pandemics or other public health emergencies, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19 \\nand its variants.  In March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted \\nin governments around the world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, \\n including “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures. \\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 (including any variants) and any preventive or protective actions taken by governmental \\nauthorities may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations, supply chain, customers, and transportation \\nnetworks, including business shutdown or disruptions.  The extent to which COVID-19 and its variants may adversely \\nimpact the Company’s business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, depends \\nupon the severity and duration of the outbreak and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its \\neffect.  Any resulting financial impact cannot be estimated reasonably at this time, but may materially adversely affect \\nthe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  Even after the COVID-19 pandemic \\nhas subsided, the Company may experience materially adverse impacts to its business due to any resulting economic \\ndownturn.  Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of COVID-19 and its variants have caused volatility in \\nfinancial and other capital markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact the Company’s stock price, its \\nability to access capital markets, and the value of its investment portfolio.  To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic \\nadversely affects the Company’s business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the \\nother risks described in this Annual Report, such as those relating to the Company’s products and financial \\n performance. \\nThe Company may suffer adverse consequences if it is deemed an investment company under the Investment \\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). \\nUnder Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is, or \\nholds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or \\n11\\x0c \\n \\n \\n13 \\n \\n \\ntrading in securities. The Company believes that it is not an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the \\nInvestment Company Act because it does not hold itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, \\nreinvesting, or trading  in securities. Rather, the Company has been a manufacturer of heavy equipment used in the \\nproduction of asphalt for highway construction and environmental control equipment for over 50 years. The Company’s \\ncore products include asphalt plants, combustion systems, and fluid heat transfer systems. The Company is expanding \\nits product offerings through new product introductions and its 2020 acquisition of an asphalt paver product line.  \\nUnder Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is \\nengaged, or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities and \\nowns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets \\n(exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. As reflected on the Company’s \\nbalance sheet at September 30, 2021, the Company owns a significant amount of marketable securities, which include \\ncash, cash equivalents, government and corporate bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and equities. Section \\n3(a)(2) defines the term “investment securities”, as used in Section 3(a)(1)(C) to include all marketable securities except \\ngovernment securities and cash and cash equivalents.  The value of the Company’s investment securities exceeded 40% \\nof the value of its total assets (excluding government securities and cash items) at September 30, 2021. Because of the \\nvalue of its investment securities, the Company may be deemed an investment company. The Company believes that it \\nis not an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act because it does not propose to \\nengage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities.  In addition, if the Company \\nwas deemed an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C), it believes that it will qualify for an exemption from the \\ndefinition of an investment company as it is primarily engaged in a business other than that of investing, reinvesting, \\nowning, holding, or trading  in securities.  As noted above, the Company is primarily engaged in the manufacturing of \\nheavy equipment. If the SEC or a court challenged the Company’s status as an operating company, it could incur \\nsignificant legal expenses.   \\nIf the Company was deemed to be, and was required to register as an investment company, the Company would be \\nforced to comply with the legal requirements of the Investment Company Act that would regulate the manner in which \\nthe Company would be permitted to conduct its business activities.  As an investment company, the Company would be \\n(i) subjected to disclosure and accounting guidance geared toward investment, rather than operating, companies; (ii) \\nsignificantly limited in its ability to borrow money, issue options, issue multiple classes of stock and debt, and engage in \\ntransactions with affiliates; and (iii) required to undertake significant costs and expenses to meet other disclosure, \\n reporting, and regulatory requirements to which it would be subject as a registered investment company. \\nThe Company faces risks with the acquisition of Blaw-Knox and any future acquisitions.  \\nThe Company acquired the Blaw-Knox assets on October 1, 2020. The success of this acquisition depends, in part, on \\nthe Company’s ability to successfully grow the business and realize anticipated benefits, including any synergies. It may \\ntake longer than expected to realize growth in the business or realize anticipated benefits, which may be smaller than the \\nCompany expected. Also, there are a number of challenges and risks involved in the Company’s ability to successfully \\nintegrate Blaw-Knox with its current business. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the \\n Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. \\nAcquiring businesses or products that expand and/or complement the Company’s operations has been an element of its \\nbusiness strategy.  The Company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions that may expand and/or complement its \\nbusiness. The Company may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate favorable \\nterms in the future. Furthermore, the Company’s ability to effectively integrate any future acquisitions will depend on, \\namong other things, the adequacy of its implementation plans, the ability of its management to oversee and operate \\neffectively the combined operations, and the Company’s ability to achieve desired operational efficiencies. The \\nCompany’s failure to successfully integrate the operations of any business that it may acquire in the future may \\nadversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. \\n12\\x0c \\n \\n \\n14 \\n \\n \\nThere can be a shortage of skilled production workers, especially those with welding and/or fabricating \\ncapabilities.  The Company could experience difficulty hiring or replacing those individuals, which could adversely \\naffect its business. \\nOur fabrication process requires skilled production workers.  If we are unable to retain and hire an adequate number of \\nindividuals with welding and fabrication capabilities, this could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial \\nobjectives.  In addition, if demand for skilled production workers were to significantly outstrip supply, wages for these \\nworkers could dramatically increase and could affect our financial performance. \\n \\n \\n  \\nITEM 1B \\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS \\n  None  \\nITEM 2  \\nPROPERTIES \\nThe following table lists the operating properties owned or leased by the Company as of September 30, 2021: \\n \\n \\nLocation \\n \\n \\nAcreage \\n \\nBuilding \\nSquare \\nFootage \\n \\n \\nPrincipal Function \\nMarquette, Iowa  \\n72.0 \\n137,000 Owned offices and manufacturing - Gencor \\nOrlando, Florida \\n27.0 \\n215,000 Owned corporate offices and manufacturing - Gencor \\nChambersburg, Pennsylvania \\n7.4 \\n101,500 Leased offices and manufacturing – Blaw-Knox \\n  \\nITEM 3  \\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS \\nThe Company has various litigation and claims, either as a plaintiff or defendant, pending as of the date of this Annual \\nReport, which have occurred in the ordinary course of business, and which may be covered in whole, or in part, by \\ninsurance.

These statements by \\ntheir nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond the Company’s control. Actual \\nresults may differ materially depending on a variety of important factors, including the financial condition of the \\nCompany’s customers, changes in the economic and competitive environments, the performance of the investment \\nportfolio and the demand for the Company’s products. \\nFor information concerning these factors and related matters, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A in this Annual \\nReport.  However, other factors besides those referenced could adversely affect the Company’s results, and you should \\nnot consider any such list of factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.  Any forward-looking \\nstatements made by the Company herein speak as of the date of this Annual Report.  The Company does not undertake \\nto update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. \\nOverview \\nGencor is a leading manufacturer of heavy machinery used in the production of highway construction equipment and \\nmaterials and environmental control equipment. The Company’s core products include asphalt pavers, hot mix asphalt \\nplants, combustion systems, fluid heat transfer systems and asphalt pavers. The Company’s products are manufactured \\n at three facilities in the United States. \\nBecause the Company’s products are sold primarily to the highway construction industry, the business is seasonal in \\nnature. Traditionally, the Company’s customers reduce their purchases of new equipment for shipment during the \\nsummer and fall months to avoid disrupting their peak season for highway construction and related repair work. The \\nmajority of orders for the Company’s products are thus received between October and February, with a significant \\nvolume of shipments occurring in the late winter and spring.  The principal factors driving demand for the Company’s \\nproducts are the overall economic conditions, the level of government funding for domestic highway construction and \\nrepair, Canadian infrastructure spending, the need for spare parts, fluctuations in the price of liquid asphalt, and a trend \\n  towards larger more efficient asphalt plants.  \\nOn November 15, 2021, President Biden signed into law a five-year, $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, the Infrastructure \\nInvestment and Jobs Act (the “IIJ Act”), including $550 billion in new spending and reauthorization of $650 billion in \\n previously allocated funds. The IIJ Act provides $110 billion for the nation's highways, bridges and roads. \\nCalifornia’s Senate Bill 1 (“SB1”), the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017, was signed into law on April 28, \\n2017. The legislative package invests $54 billion over the next decade to fix roads, freeways and bridges in \\ncommunities across California and puts more dollars towards transit and safety. These funds will be allocated to state \\nand local projects. Additionally, numerous other states have taken steps to increase their gas tax revenues in recent \\n years. \\nFluctuations in the price of carbon steel, which is a significant cost and material used in the manufacturing of the \\nCompany’s equipment, may affect the Company’s financial performance.  The Company is subject to fluctuations in \\nmarket prices for raw materials, such as steel. If the Company is unable to purchase materials it requires or is unable to \\npass on price increases to its customers or otherwise reduce its cost of goods sold, its business results of operations and \\nfinancial condition may be adversely affected.  \\n \\n15\\x0c \\n \\n \\n18 \\n \\n \\nAlso, a significant increase in the price of liquid asphalt could decrease demand for hot mix asphalt paving materials \\nand certain of the Company’s products. Increases in oil prices also drive up the cost of gasoline and diesel, which results \\nin increased freight costs. Where possible, the Company will pass increased freight costs on to its customers. However, \\nthe Company may not be able to recapture all of the higher costs and thus could have a negative impact on the \\n   Company’s financial performance.  \\nThe Company believes its strategy of continuing to invest in product engineering and development and its focus on \\ndelivering the highest quality products and superior service will strengthen the Company’s market position. The \\nCompany continues to review its internal processes to identify inefficiencies and cost-reduction opportunities. The \\nCompany will continue to scrutinize its relationships with suppliers to ensure it is achieving the highest quality \\n materials and services at the most competitive cost. \\nCOVID-19 Pandemic \\nThe Company continues to monitor and evaluate the risks to public health and the slowdown in overall business activity \\nrelated to the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, including impacts on its employees, customers, suppliers and \\nfinancial results.  As of the date of issuance of this Annual Report, the Company’s operations have not been \\nsignificantly impacted.  However, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve subsequent to the \\nquarter and year ended September 30, 2021 and as of the date this Annual Report is issued.  As such, the full magnitude \\nthat the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company’s financial condition and future results of operations is \\nuncertain.  Management continues to monitor the Company’s financial condition, operations, suppliers, industry, \\ncustomers, and workforce.  If the spread of COVID-19 and its variants continues, the Company’s ability to meet \\ncustomer demands for products may be impacted or its customers may experience adverse business consequences due to \\nCOVID-19 and its variants.  Reduced demand for products or ability to meet customer demand (including as a result of \\ndisruptions at the Company’s suppliers) could have a material adverse effect on its business operations and financial \\nperformance. \\nResults of Operations \\nYear ended September 30, 2021 compared with the year ended September 30, 2020 \\nNet revenue for the year ended September 30, 2021 increased 10.1% to $85.3 million from $77.4 million for the year \\nended September 30, 2020. The increase in net revenue was due primarily to paver equipment and parts sales of \\napproximately $6.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared with no paver related revenues in fiscal \\n 2020. \\nNet revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 91.7% to $20.0 million compared to $10.5 million for the \\nquarter ended September 30, 2020. The increase in net revenues reflected improved orders from prior year in \\nanticipation of the signing of a new highway bill to replace the FAST Act, which after two temporary extensions, would \\nhave expired on December 3, 2021. In addition, net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 includes $2.2 million of \\n paver equipment and parts sales compared with no paver related revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. \\nGross profit margins decreased to 21.3% in fiscal 2021 from 24.5% in fiscal 2020.  The gross profit margins for the year \\nended September 30, 2021 were negatively impacted by approximately $4.6 million of unabsorbed manufacturing labor \\nand overhead expenses related to the paver line. In addition, increases in labor rates and steel and OEM parts prices \\n contributed to the lower overall gross margins during the year ended September 30, 2021. \\nProduct engineering and development (“PED”) expenses in fiscal 2021 increased by $1,217,000 to $4,278,000 from \\n$3,061,000 in fiscal 2020 primarily due to engineering wages related to the paver line. Selling, general and \\nadministrative (“SG&A”) expenses in fiscal 2021 increased $2,843,000 to $13,199,000 from $10,356,000 in fiscal \\n2020. The higher SG&A expenses were primarily due to expenses related to the paver line and professional fees to \\nsupport business development efforts.  \\n16\\x0c \\n \\n \\n19 \\n \\n \\n \\nFiscal 2021 had operating income of $701,000 versus $5,536,000 in fiscal 2020.  The decrease in operating income was \\ndue primarily to the operational and start-up costs related to the Blaw-Knox asset acquisition and professional fees to \\n support business development efforts. \\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company acquired the Blaw-Knox assets, including inventory, fixed assets and related \\nintellectual property, from Volvo Construction Equipment North America, LLC (“Volvo CE”). The acquisition \\nprovided the Company entry into the asphalt paver sector of the asphalt industry. The acquisition was accounted for as a \\nbusiness combination under ASC 805, “Business Combinations.”  The initial purchase price of approximately $14.4 \\nmillion, which was subject to post-closing adjustments, was funded by cash on hand. After post-closing adjustments \\ntransacted during quarter ended March 31, 2021, the final purchase price was $13.8 million, including $10.4 million in \\ninventory and $3.4 million in fixed assets. There were no liabilities assumed. The accompanying consolidated financial \\nstatements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021, include the assets, liabilities and operating results of the \\npaver line. There were no paver equipment revenues during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, as the facility was \\n being readied for production which began in the quarter ended March 31, 2021.  \\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the cost basis of the investment portfolio was $93.7 million and $89.5 million, \\nrespectively.  For the year ended September 30, 2021, interest and dividend income, net of fees, from the investment \\nportfolio was $1,306,000, as compared to $2,321,000 for year ended September 30, 2020. Interest income for the year \\nended September 30, 2021, also included $456,000 of interest collected from a customer. The higher interest income \\nfrom the investment portfolio in fiscal 2020 reflects the impact from a larger investment in corporate bonds and a higher \\naverage yield to maturity. The fiscal 2021 corporate bonds were reduced as the related investments were partially \\nliquidated to fund the Blaw-Knox acquisition. Net realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities were \\n$4,171,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021 versus net realized and unrealized losses of $(1,160,000) for the year \\nended September 30, 2020. The fiscal 2020 investment losses reflect the decline in the domestic equity markets from the \\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The total cash, cash equivalents and investments balance at September 30, 2021 \\nwas $118.2 million, compared to the September 30, 2020 cash, cash equivalents and investments balance of $125.1 \\n million, a decrease of $6.9 million. \\n The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 12.5% versus 17.2% in fiscal 2020.  \\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company generated $335,000 of federal research and development tax credits (“R&D Credits”), all \\nof which were used in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2020, the Company generated $421,000 of R&D Credits, all of which were \\nused in fiscal 2020. There were no R&D Credits carryforwards as of September 30, 2021 or September 30, 2020.  \\nNet income for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $5,805,000 or $0.39 per diluted share versus net income of \\n$5,531,000 or $0.38 per diluted share for the year ended September 30, 2020.  \\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \\n The Company generates capital resources through operations and returns from its investments.  \\nThe Company had no long-term debt outstanding at September 30, 2021 or 2020. As of September 30, 2021, the \\nCompany has funded $85,000 in cash deposits at insurance companies to cover collateral needs. In April 2020, a \\nfinancial institution issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit (“letter of credit”) on behalf of the Company for the \\nbenefit of one of the Company’s insurance carriers.  The maximum amount that can be drawn by the beneficiary under \\nthe letter of credit is $150,000.  The letter of credit expires in April 2022, unless terminated earlier, and can be extended, \\nas provided by the agreement.  The Company intends to renew the letter of credit for as long as the Company does \\nbusiness with the beneficiary insurance carrier.  The letter is collateralized by restricted cash of the same amount on any \\noutstanding drawings.  To date, no amounts have been drawn under the letter of credit. \\n \\n17\\x0c \\n \\n \\n20 \\n \\n \\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company had $23.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $95.0 million in \\nmarketable securities. The marketable securities are invested through a professional investment management firm. The \\n securities may be liquidated at any time into cash and cash equivalents.  \\nThe Company’s backlog, which includes orders received through the filing date of this Annual Report, was $64.1 \\nmillion at September 30, 2021 versus $34.6 million at September 30, 2020. The Company’s working capital was $155.4 \\nmillion at September 30, 2021 versus $153.2 million at September 30, 2020.  \\nThe significant purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities shown on the consolidated statements of cash \\nflows typically reflect the frequent purchase and sale of United States treasury bills. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, \\nthe Company liquidated approximately $17.0 million of its investments. The cash was primarily used to fund the \\nacquisition of the Blaw-Knox assets. \\nYear ended September 30, 2021 compared with the year ended September 30, 2020 \\nCash provided by operations in fiscal 2021 was $3,820,000, primarily resulting from net income. The significant \\npurchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows reflect the \\nrecurring purchases and sales of United States treasury bills. The decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of \\nbillings of $4.5 million reflects the completion and shipment of several large contracts with revenues recognized over \\ntime during the year ended September 30, 2021. Excluding the impact of the Blaw-Knox acquisition, inventories \\nincreased by $4.4 million primarily due to progress on several large contract orders where revenue is recognized at a \\npoint in time and some stock build to compensate for the longer lead times from suppliers. Accounts payable increased \\nby $1.4 million due to the additional payables related to the Blaw-Knox business along with the increase in inventory. \\nCustomer deposits increased $1.4 million, reflecting the down payments on contract jobs, including several recent \\n orders where revenues are recognized over time but work is yet to begin. \\nCash provided by operations in fiscal 2020 was $26,774,000, primarily resulting from the sale of investment securities \\nand net income. The decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $7.4 million reflects the \\ncompletion of customer contracts with revenues recognized over time that were open at the end of fiscal 2019 and the \\nreduced number of such contracts open at the end of fiscal 2020. The increase in inventories of $1.7 million reflects the \\nprogress on several contract jobs where revenues are recognized at a point in time. Customer deposits increased $1.9 \\nmillion, reflecting the down payments on these jobs. \\nCash flows used in investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 of $16,436,000 were related to the \\nacquisition of the Blaw-Knox paver line and subsequent capital expenditures, primarily for systems software and \\nleasehold improvements for the paver line’s manufacturing facility. Cash provided by financing activities of $264,000 \\nfor the year ended September 30, 2021, related to proceeds from the exercise of stock options. \\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2020 of $1,595,000 for the year ended September \\n30, 2020, related primarily to capital expenditures for manufacturing equipment. Cash provided by financing activities \\nof $103,000 in fiscal 2020 related to proceeds from the exercise of stock options. \\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions \\nThe Company believes the following discussion addresses it’s most critical accounting policies, which are those that are \\nmost important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require \\nmanagement’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about \\nthe effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Accounting policies, in addition to the critical accounting policies \\n  referenced below, are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Accounting Policies.” \\n \\n18\\x0c \\n \\n \\n21 \\n \\n \\nEstimates and Assumptions \\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses certain estimates and assumptions that may \\naffect reported amounts and disclosures.  Estimates and assumptions are used, among other places, when accounting for \\ncertain revenue (e.g., contract accounting), expense, and asset and liability valuations.  The Company believes that the \\nestimates and assumptions made in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements are reasonable, but are inherently \\nuncertain.  Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events may occur.  The Company is subject \\n to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results. \\nRevenues & Expenses \\nThe Company accounts for revenues and related expenses under the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from \\n Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), as amended (“ASU No. 2014-09”). \\nRevenues from contracts with customers for the design, manufacture and sale of custom equipment are recognized over \\ntime when the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the equipment. Control of the equipment \\ntransfers over time as the equipment is unique to the specific contract and thus does not create an asset with an \\nalternative use to the Company. Revenues and related costs are recognized in proportion to actual labor costs incurred, \\nas compared with total estimated labor costs expected to be incurred during the entire contract. All incremental costs \\nrelated to obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred as the amortization period is less than one year. Changes to total \\n estimated contract costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined.  \\nContract assets (excluding accounts receivable) under contracts with customers represent revenue recognized in excess \\nof amounts billed on equipment sales recognized over time. These contract assets were $1,903,000 and $6,405,000 at \\nSeptember 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in current assets as costs and estimated earnings in excess \\nof billings on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company anticipates that all of the contract assets at \\n September 30, 2021, will be billed and collected within one year.   \\nRevenues from all other contracts for the design and manufacture of equipment, for service and for parts sales, net of \\nany discounts and return allowances, are recorded at a point in time when control of the goods or services has been \\n transferred. Control of the goods or service typically transfers at time of shipment or upon completion of the service.  \\nPayment for equipment under contract with customers is typically due prior to shipment. Payment for services under \\ncontract with customers is due as services are completed. Accounts receivable related to contracts with customers at \\n September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 were $210,000 and $223,000, respectively. \\nProduct warranty costs are estimated using historical experience and known issues and are charged to production costs \\n as revenue is recognized. \\nUnder certain contracts with customers, recognition of a portion of the consideration received may be deferred and \\nrecorded as a contract liability if the Company has to satisfy a future obligation, such as to provide installation \\nassistance. There were no contract liabilities other than customer deposits at September 30, 2021 and September 30, \\n2020. Customer deposits related to contracts with customers were $5,244,000 and $3,853,000 at September 30, 2021 \\n and 2020, respectively, and are included in current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. \\nThe Company records revenues earned for shipping and handling as freight revenue at the time of shipment, regardless \\nof whether or not it is identified as a separate performance obligation.  The cost of shipping and handling is classified as \\n cost of goods sold concurrently. \\nProvisions for estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related \\nsales are recorded. Returns and allowances, which reduce product revenue, are estimated using historical experience.  \\nAll product engineering and development costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses are charged to \\noperations as incurred.  Provision is made for any anticipated contract losses in the period that the loss becomes evident. \\n19\\x0c \\n \\n \\n22 \\n \\n \\n \\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by performing a specific review of all account balances greater than \\n90 days past due and other higher risk amounts to determine collectability and also adjusting for any known customer \\npayment issues with account balances in the less-than-90-day past due aging buckets. Account balances are charged off \\nagainst the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are determined to be uncollectable. Any recoveries of account \\nbalances previously considered in the allowance for doubtful accounts reduce future additions to the allowance for \\n doubtful accounts.  \\nInventories \\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined under the first-in, first-out \\n(“FIFO”) method and net realizable value defined as the estimated selling price of goods less reasonable costs of \\ncompletion and delivery (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Appropriate consideration is given to \\nobsolescence, excessive levels, deterioration, possible alternative uses and other factors in determining net realizable \\nvalue. The cost of work in process and finished goods includes materials, direct labor, variable costs and overhead. The \\nCompany evaluates the need to record inventory adjustments on all inventories, including raw materials, work in \\nprocess, finished goods, spare parts and used equipment. Used equipment acquired by the Company on trade-in from \\ncustomers is carried at estimated net realizable value. Unless specific circumstances warrant different treatment \\nregarding inventory obsolescence, an allowance is established to reduce the cost basis of inventories three to four years \\nold by 50%, the cost basis of inventories four to five years old by 75%, and the cost basis of inventories greater than \\nfive years old to zero. Inventory is typically reviewed for obsolescence on an annual basis computed as of September \\n30, the Company’s fiscal year end. If significant known changes in trends, technology or other specific circumstances \\n that warrant consideration occur during the year, then the impact on obsolescence is considered at that time.  \\nInvestments \\nMarketable debt and equity securities are categorized as trading securities and are thus marked to market and stated at \\nfair value.  Fair value is determined using the quoted closing or latest bid prices for Level 1 investments and market \\nstandard valuation methodologies for Level 2 investments.  Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are \\ndetermined by specific identification and are recognized as incurred in the consolidated income statements.  Net \\nunrealized gains and losses are reported in the consolidated income statements and represent the change in the fair value \\n of investment holdings during the period.  \\nLong Lived Asset Impairment \\nProperty and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An \\nimpairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash \\nflows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be \\nrecorded is calculated by the excess over its fair value of the asset’s carrying value. Fair value is generally determined \\n using a discounted cash flow analysis.  \\nInflation \\nThe overall effects of inflation on the Company’s business during fiscal 2021 have been significant relative to prior \\nyears.  The Company monitors the prices it charges for its products and services on an ongoing basis and has been able \\n to adjust its prices to take into account future changes in the rate of inflation. \\nContractual Obligations \\nThe Company had no long-term or short-term debt as of September 30, 2021 and there was no long-term debt facility in \\nplace at September 30, 2021. \\n \\n20\\x0c \\n \\n \\n23 \\n \\n \\nIn April 2020, a financial institution issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit (“letter of credit”) on behalf of the \\nCompany for the benefit of one of the Company’s insurance carriers.  The maximum amount that can be drawn by the \\nbeneficiary under the letter of credit is $150,000.  The letter of credit expires in April 2022, unless terminated earlier, \\nand can be extended, as provided by the agreement.  The Company intends to renew the letter of credit for as long as the \\nCompany does business with the beneficiary insurance carrier.  The letter is collateralized by restricted cash of the same \\n amount on any outstanding drawings.  To date, no amounts have been drawn under the letter of credit. \\nOn August 28, 2020, the Company entered into a three year operating lease for property related to the manufacturing \\nand warehousing of the Blaw-Knox paver business. The lease term is for the period September 1, 2020 through August \\n31, 2023. On October 9, 2020, the Company entered into an operating lease for additional warehousing space for paver \\n inventory. The lease term is for one year beginning November 2020 with automatic one-year renewals. \\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \\nNone \\n \\n \\n21\\x0c \\n \\n \\n24 \\n \\n \\nITEM 8  \\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA \\n \\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES \\nGENCOR INDUSTRIES, INC. \\n \\n \\nPage \\n \\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  ..........................................................  \\n25 \\n \\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 .................................................  \\n27 \\n \\nConsolidated Income Statements for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 ....................  \\n28 \\n \\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the years ended \\nSeptember 30, 2021 and 2020 .........................................................................................................  \\n29 \\n \\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 .........  \\n30 \\n \\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements ...................................................................................  \\n31 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAll other schedules are omitted because they are not applicable or the required information is shown in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements or notes thereto. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n22\\x0c \\n \\n \\n25 \\n \\n \\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \\n \\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Gencor Industries, Inc.: \\n Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements \\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gencor Industries, Inc. (the “Company”) as of \\nSeptember 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows \\nfor each of the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \\nconsolidated financial statements).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material \\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and \\nits cash flows for each of the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, in conformity with accounting principles \\n generally accepted in the United States of America. \\n Basis for Opinion \\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to \\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public \\naccounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are \\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the \\n applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material \\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an \\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting.  As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of \\ninternal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the \\n Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial \\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures \\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial \\nstatements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  We believe that our \\n audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\n Critical Audit Matters \\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated \\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate \\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially \\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way \\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical \\naudit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which \\n they relate. \\n Allowance for Slow-moving and Obsolete Inventories \\nAs disclosed in Note 1 of the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company records an \\nestimated allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventories to state the Company’s inventories at the lower of cost or \\nnet realizable value.  The Company relies on, among other things, past usage, sales experience, recent order and quote \\n23\\x0c \\n \\n \\n26 \\n \\n \\nactivity, possible alternative uses, future sales forecasts, and its strategic business plan to develop the estimate.  As a \\nresult of management’s assessment, the Company recorded an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventories of \\n approximately $5,397,000 as of September 30, 2021. \\nAuditing management’s estimate of the allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventories, including those acquired \\nin a business combination, involved subjective evaluation and high degree of auditor judgement due to significant \\n assumptions involved in estimating future inventory turnover and sales. \\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our \\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  We obtained an understanding of the design of internal \\ncontrols that address the risks of material misstatement relating to recording inventory at the lower of cost or net \\nrealizable value.  We tested the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in calculating the inventory \\nallowance, including testing of a sample of inventory usage transactions, and recomputed the allowance calculation.  \\nWe also evaluated the Company’s ability to accurately estimate the assumptions used to develop the estimate by \\ncomparing historical allowance amounts to the history of actual inventory write-offs.  Furthermore, we reviewed \\n management’s business plan and forecasts of future sales. \\n Revenue from Contracts with Customers where Revenue is Recognized over Time \\nAs disclosed in Note 1 of the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes \\nrevenues from contracts with customers for the design, manufacture and sale of custom equipment over time when the \\nperformance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the equipment. Control of the equipment transfers over \\ntime, as the equipment is unique to the specific contract and thus does not create an asset with an alternative use to the \\nCompany. Revenues and costs are recognized in proportion to actual labor costs incurred, as compared with total \\nestimated labor costs expected to be incurred, during the entire contract. Changes to total estimated contract costs or \\nlosses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined.  The Company recorded approximately \\n $24,093,000 in revenue from custom equipment sales contracts during the year ended September 30, 2021. \\nAuditing management’s estimate of total estimated labor costs expected to be incurred for the entire contract with \\nrespect to incomplete contracts, and the percentage of completion on those contracts as of the end of the year involved \\nsubjective evaluation and high degree of auditor judgement due to significant assumptions involved in estimating total \\n labor costs to complete. \\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our \\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  We obtained an understanding of the design of internal \\ncontrols that address the risks of material misstatement relating to recording revenue from contracts with customers \\nwhere revenue is recognized over time.  We tested the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in \\ncalculating the percentage of completion on incomplete contracts, including review of contracts, change orders, and \\nunderlying labor and material costs, and recomputed the percentage of completion on individual contracts.  We also \\nevaluated the Company’s ability to accurately estimate the assumptions used to develop the estimate by comparing \\n historical cost estimates to actual costs on completed contracts.   \\n We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001. \\n /s/ MSL, P.A. \\nMSL, P.A. \\n Certified Public Accountants \\nOrlando, Florida \\n December 17, 2021 \\n \\n24\\x0c \\n \\n \\n27 \\n \\n \\nPart I.

the Years Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 \\n \\n \\nNOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nGencor Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) is a diversified, heavy machinery \\nmanufacturer for the production of highway construction materials and environmental control machinery and \\nequipment. The Company’s core products include asphalt plants, combustion systems, fluid heat transfer systems and \\n asphalt pavers. The Company’s products are manufactured at three facilities in the United States. \\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Gencor Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  All \\n significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company acquired the Blaw-Knox paver line and associated assets, including inventory, fixed \\nassets and related intellectual property, from Volvo CE. The acquisition provided the Company entry into the asphalt \\npaver sector of the asphalt industry. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, \\n“Business Combinations.”  The initial purchase price of approximately $14.4 million, which was subject to post-\\nclosing adjustments, was funded by cash on hand. After post-closing adjustments transacted during quarter ended \\nMarch 31, 2021, the final purchase price was $13.8 million, including $10.4 million in inventory and $3.4 million in \\nfixed assets. There were no liabilities assumed. The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of September \\n 30, 2021, include the assets, liabilities and operating results of the paver line for the year then ended.  \\nAccounting Pronouncements and Policies  \\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”). With adoption of this \\nstandard, lessees will have to recognize most leases as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on their balance sheet. \\nFor income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or \\nfinance. Classification will be based on criteria that are similar to those applied in current lease accounting. ASU 2016-\\n02 must be applied on a modified retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, \\n2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 in \\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2020. The initial adoption of ASU 2016-02 did not have a significant impact on its \\n consolidated financial statements.  \\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement - Disclosure Framework (Topic 820) (ASU \\n2018-13). The updated guidance improves the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements, including, among \\nother things, addition of certain disclosures related to level 3 fair value measurements, and removal of disclosure \\nrequirements for (i) the amount and reasons for transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and (ii) \\npolicy and timing of transfers between fair value hierarchy levels. The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years, \\nand interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company adopted ASU 2018-\\n13 for the quarter ended December 31, 2020.  The application of this guidance did not have a material effect on our \\n disclosures.   \\nNo other accounting pronouncements recently issued or newly effective have had, or are expected to have, a material \\n impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  \\nUse of Estimates \\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles \\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the \\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of \\n revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. \\n \\n \\n \\n31 \\n GENCOR INDUSTRIES, INC. \\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \\nFor the Years Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 \\n \\n \\nNOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nGencor Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) is a diversified, heavy machinery \\nmanufacturer for the production of highway construction materials and environmental control machinery and \\nequipment. The Company’s core products include asphalt plants, combustion systems, fluid heat transfer systems and \\n asphalt pavers. The Company’s products are manufactured at three facilities in the United States. \\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Gencor Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  All \\n significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company acquired the Blaw-Knox paver line and associated assets, including inventory, fixed \\nassets and related intellectual property, from Volvo CE. The acquisition provided the Company entry into the asphalt \\npaver sector of the asphalt industry. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, \\n“Business Combinations.”  The initial purchase price of approximately $14.4 million, which was subject to post-\\nclosing adjustments, was funded by cash on hand. After post-closing adjustments transacted during quarter ended \\nMarch 31, 2021, the final purchase price was $13.8 million, including $10.4 million in inventory and $3.4 million in \\nfixed assets. There were no liabilities assumed. The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of September \\n 30, 2021, include the assets, liabilities and operating results of the paver line for the year then ended.  \\nAccounting Pronouncements and Policies  \\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”). With adoption of this \\nstandard, lessees will have to recognize most leases as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on their balance sheet. \\nFor income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or \\nfinance. Classification will be based on criteria that are similar to those applied in current lease accounting. ASU 2016-\\n02 must be applied on a modified retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, \\n2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 in \\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2020. The initial adoption of ASU 2016-02 did not have a significant impact on its \\n consolidated financial statements.  \\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement - Disclosure Framework (Topic 820) (ASU \\n2018-13). The updated guidance improves the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements, including, among \\nother things, addition of certain disclosures related to level 3 fair value measurements, and removal of disclosure \\nrequirements for (i) the amount and reasons for transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and (ii) \\npolicy and timing of transfers between fair value hierarchy levels. The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years, \\nand interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company adopted ASU 2018-\\n13 for the quarter ended December 31, 2020.  The application of this guidance did not have a material effect on our \\n disclosures.   \\nNo other accounting pronouncements recently issued or newly effective have had, or are expected to have, a material \\n impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  \\nUse of Estimates \\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles \\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the \\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of \\n revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. \\n \\n \\n29\\x0c \\n32 \\nEarnings per Share  \\nThe consolidated financial statements include basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) information.  Basic EPS is \\nbased on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS is based on the sum of the weighted-\\naverage number of shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents.   \\nThe weighted-average shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options included in the diluted EPS calculation at \\nSeptember 30, 2021 were 236,000, which equates to 116,000 dilutive common stock equivalents. For the year ended \\nSeptember 30, 2020, the weighted-average shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options included in the diluted \\nEPS calculation were 256,000, which equates to 125,000 dilutive common stock equivalents. Weighted-average shares \\nissuable upon the exercise of stock options, which were not included in the diluted EPS calculation because they were \\nanti-dilutive, were zero in 2021 and 7,000 in 2020. \\nThe following presents the calculation of the basic and diluted EPS for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020: \\n \\n2021 \\n \\n2020 \\n \\nNet Income \\nShares \\nEPS \\n \\nNet Income \\nShares \\nEPS \\nBasic EPS \\n$5,805,000 \\n14,614,000 \\n$0.40 \\n \\n$5,531,000  \\n14,595,000 \\n$0.38  \\nCommon stock equivalents \\n \\n116,000 \\n \\n \\n \\n125,000 \\n \\nDiluted EPS \\n$5,805,000 \\n14,730,000 \\n$0.39 \\n \\n$5,531,000   \\n14,720,000 \\n$0.38   \\n \\nCash Equivalents \\nCash equivalents consist of short-term certificates of deposit and deposits in money market accounts with original \\n maturities of three months or less. \\nMarketable Securities and Fair Value Measurements \\nMarketable debt and equity securities are categorized as trading securities and are thus marked to market and stated at \\nfair value.  Fair value is determined using the quoted closing or latest bid prices for Level 1 investments and market \\nstandard valuation methodologies for Level 2 investments.  Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are \\ndetermined by specific identification and are recognized as incurred in the consolidated income statements.  Net \\n  changes in unrealized gains and losses are reported in the consolidated income statements in the current period.  \\nFair Value Measurements \\nThe fair value of financial instruments is presented based upon a hierarchy of levels that prioritizes the inputs of \\nvaluation techniques used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in \\nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs \\n(Level 3 measurements).  A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of \\nany input that is significant to the fair value measurement.   \\nThe fair value of marketable equity securities (stocks), mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, government securities, \\nand cash and money funds, are substantially based on quoted market prices (Level 1).  Corporate bonds are valued \\nusing market standard valuation methodologies, including: discounted cash flow methodologies, and matrix pricing or \\nother similar techniques. The inputs to these market standard valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to: \\ninterest rates, credit standing of the issuer or counterparty, industry sector of the issuer, coupon rate, call provisions, \\nmaturity, estimated duration and assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated future cash flows. In addition to bond \\ncharacteristics, the valuation methodologies incorporate market data, such as actual trades completed, bids and actual \\ndealer quotes, where such information is available. Accordingly, the estimated fair values are based on available \\nmarket information and judgments about financial instruments (Level 2).  Fair values of the Level 2 investments are \\nprovided by the Company’s professional investment management firms. From time to time the Company may transfer \\ncash between its marketable securities portfolio and operating cash and cash equivalents. \\n \\n \\n30\\x0c \\n33 \\nThe following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Company’s assets measured at fair value as \\nof September 30, 2021: \\n \\n \\nFair Value Measurements \\n \\nLevel 1 \\n \\nLevel 2 \\n \\nLevel 3 \\n \\nTotal \\nEquities \\n$14,734,000 \\n \\n$ - \\n \\n$ - \\n \\n$14,734,000 \\nMutual Funds \\n10,357,000 \\n \\n- \\n \\n- \\n \\n10,357,000 \\nExchange-Traded Funds \\n9,458,000 \\n \\n- \\n \\n- \\n \\n9,458,000 \\nCorporate Bonds \\n- \\n \\n24,853,000 \\n \\n- \\n \\n24,853,000 \\nGovernment Securities \\n30,999,000 \\n \\n- \\n \\n- \\n \\n30,999,000 \\nCash and Money Funds \\n4,575,000 \\n \\n- \\n \\n- \\n \\n4,575,000 \\nTotal \\n$70,123,000 \\n \\n$24,853,000 \\n \\n$ - \\n \\n$94,976,000 \\n \\nNet unrealized gains reported during fiscal 2021 on trading securities still held as of September 30, 2021, were \\n$1,302,000.

There were no transfers of investments between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year ended September \\n 30, 2020.  \\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company liquidated approximately $17.0 million of its investments. The cash \\nwas primarily used to fund the acquisition of the Blaw-Knox assets, including inventory, fixed assets and related \\nintellectual property, from Volvo CE. \\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, customer deposits and \\n accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. \\nForeign Currency Transactions \\nGains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income and were not significant during \\n the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. \\nRisk Management \\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash \\nand cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable.  The Company maintains its cash accounts in \\nvarious domestic financial institutions which may from time to time exceed federally insured limits.  Operating cash is \\nretained in overnight sweep accounts which allow for offsets to treasury service charges. The marketable securities \\ninclude investments in cash and money funds, mutual funds, exchange traded funds (“ETF’s”), corporate bonds, \\n31\\x0c \\n34 \\ngovernment securities and stocks through professional investment management firms.  Investment securities are \\n exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and credit risks.   \\nThe Company’s customers are not concentrated in any specific geographic region, but are concentrated in the road and \\nhighway construction industry.  The Company extends limited credit on parts sales to its customers based upon their \\ncredit-worthiness. Generally, the Company requires a significant up-front deposit before beginning manufacturing on \\ncomplete asphalt plant and component orders, and requires full payment subject to hold-back provisions prior to \\nshipment.  The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the credit risk of specific \\n customers, historical trends and other pertinent information. \\nInventories \\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined under the FIFO method \\nand net realizable value defined as the estimated selling price of goods less reasonable costs of completion and \\ndelivery. Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excessive levels, deterioration, possible alternative uses \\nand other factors in determining net realizable value. The cost of work in process and finished goods includes \\nmaterials, direct labor, variable costs and overhead. The Company evaluates the need to record inventory adjustments \\non all inventories, including raw material, work in process, finished goods, spare parts and used equipment. Used \\nequipment acquired by the Company on trade-in from customers is carried at estimated net realizable value. Unless \\nspecific circumstances warrant different treatment regarding inventory obsolescence, an allowance is established to \\nreduce the cost basis of inventories three to four years old by 50%, the cost basis of inventories four to five years old \\nby 75%, and the cost basis of inventories greater than five years old to zero. Inventory is typically reviewed for \\nobsolescence on an annual basis computed as of September 30, the Company’s fiscal year end. If significant known \\nchanges in trends, technology or other specific circumstances that warrant consideration occur during the year, then the \\n impact on obsolescence is considered at that time.  \\nChanges in the allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventories are as follows: \\n   \\n       2021 \\n \\n       2020 \\nBalance, beginning of year \\n$ 4,617,000 \\n \\n$ 4,700,000 \\n  Charged to cost of sales \\n1,355,000 \\n \\n401,000 \\n  Disposal of inventory, net of recoveries \\n(575,000) \\n \\n(484,000) \\nBalance, end of year \\n$5,397,000 \\n \\n$ 4,617,000 \\n \\nProperty and Equipment \\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost (see Note 4).

An \\nimpairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash \\nflows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be \\nrecorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined \\nusing a discounted cash flow analysis. No such impairment losses were recorded during the years ended September 30, \\n  2021 and 2020. \\n \\n \\n34 \\ngovernment securities and stocks through professional investment management firms.

Control of the equipment \\ntransfers over time, as the equipment is unique to the specific contract and thus does not create an asset with an \\nalternative use to the Company. Revenues and costs are recognized in proportion to actual labor costs incurred, as \\ncompared with total estimated labor costs expected to be incurred, during the entire contract. All incremental costs \\nrelated to obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred, as the amortization period is less than one year. Changes to \\n total estimated contract costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined.  \\nContract assets (excluding accounts receivable) under contracts with customers represent revenue recognized in excess \\nof amounts billed on equipment sales recognized over time. These contract assets were $1,903,000 and $6,405,000 at \\nSeptember 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in current assets as costs and estimated earnings in excess \\nof billings on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company anticipates that all of the contract assets at \\n September 30, 2021, will be billed and collected within one year.   \\nRevenues from all other contracts for the design and manufacture of equipment, for service and for parts sales, net of \\nany discounts and return allowances, are recorded at a point in time when control of the goods or services has been \\n transferred. Control of the goods or service typically transfers at time of shipment or upon completion of the service.  \\nPayment for equipment under contract with customers is typically due prior to shipment. Payment for services under \\ncontract with customers is due as services are completed. Accounts receivable related to contracts with customers for \\n equipment sales were $210,000 and $223,000 at September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. \\nProduct warranty costs are estimated using historical experience and known issues and are charged to production costs \\n as revenue is recognized.  \\n  Changes in the accrual for warranty and related costs are composed of the following: \\n          2021 \\n \\n      2020 \\nBalance, beginning of year \\n$ 299,000 \\n \\n$ 277,000 \\n  Warranties issued \\n280,000 \\n \\n375,000 \\n  Warranties settled \\n(288,000) \\n \\n(353,000) \\nBalance, end of year \\n291,000 \\n \\n$ 299,000 \\n \\nProvisions for estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related \\n sales are recorded.

Provision is made for any anticipated contract losses in the period that the loss becomes \\n evident. \\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by performing a specific review of all account balances greater than \\n90 days past due and other higher risk amounts to determine collectability, and also adjusting for any known customer \\npayment issues with account balances in the less-than-90-day past due aging category. Account balances are charged \\noff against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are determined to be uncollectible. Any recoveries of \\naccount balances previously considered in the allowance for doubtful accounts reduce future additions to the allowance \\nfor doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts also includes an estimate for returns and allowances. \\nProvisions for estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments, are provided for in the same period the related \\nsales are recorded. Returns and allowances, which reduce product revenue, are estimated using known issues and \\n historical experience.  \\n  Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are composed of the following: \\n           2021 \\n \\n          2020 \\nBalance, beginning of year \\n$ 442,000 \\n \\n$ 459,000 \\n  Provision for doubtful accounts \\n50,000 \\n \\n50,000 \\n  Provision for estimated returns and allowances \\n175,000 \\n \\n205,000 \\n  Uncollectible accounts written off \\n(60,000) \\n \\n(5,000) \\n  Returns and allowances issued \\n(286,000) \\n \\n(267,000) \\nBalance, end of year \\n$321,000 \\n \\n$442,000 \\n \\nShipping and Handling Costs \\n Shipping and handling costs are included in production costs in the consolidated income statements. \\nIncome Taxes \\nIncome taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and \\nprimarily consist of taxes currently due, plus deferred taxes (see Note 6 – Income Taxes). \\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have \\nbeen included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns using current tax rates. The Company and its \\ndomestic subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return.  \\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in \\nwhich the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used. The effect on deferred \\ntax assets and liabilities of the change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment \\ndate. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of \\nthat evidence, the Company is more likely than not to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset and whether a valuation \\nallowance is needed for some portion or all of a deferred tax asset. No such valuation allowances were recorded as of \\nSeptember 30, 2021 and 2020. \\nThe Company’s income tax provision is based on management’s estimate of the effective tax rate for the full year.  The \\ntax provision in any period will be affected by, among other things, permanent, as well as temporary differences in the \\ndeductibility of certain items, in addition to changes in tax legislation. As a result, the Company may experience \\nsignificant fluctuations in the effective book tax rate (that is, its tax expense divided by pre-tax book income) from \\n \\n36 \\n2020. Customer deposits related to contracts with customers were $5,244,000 and $3,853,000 at September 30, 2021 \\n and 2020, respectively, and are included in current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. \\nThe Company records revenues earned for shipping and handling as freight revenue at the time of shipment, regardless \\nof whether or not it is identified as a separate performance obligation.  The cost of shipping and handling is classified \\n as production costs concurrently with the revenue recognition. \\nAll product engineering and development costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses are charged to \\noperations as incurred.  Provision is made for any anticipated contract losses in the period that the loss becomes \\n evident. \\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by performing a specific review of all account balances greater than \\n90 days past due and other higher risk amounts to determine collectability, and also adjusting for any known customer \\npayment issues with account balances in the less-than-90-day past due aging category. Account balances are charged \\noff against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are determined to be uncollectible. Any recoveries of \\naccount balances previously considered in the allowance for doubtful accounts reduce future additions to the allowance \\nfor doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts also includes an estimate for returns and allowances. \\nProvisions for estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments, are provided for in the same period the related \\nsales are recorded. Returns and allowances, which reduce product revenue, are estimated using known issues and \\n historical experience.  \\n  Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are composed of the following: \\n           2021 \\n \\n          2020 \\nBalance, beginning of year \\n$ 442,000 \\n \\n$ 459,000 \\n  Provision for doubtful accounts \\n50,000 \\n \\n50,000 \\n  Provision for estimated returns and allowances \\n175,000 \\n \\n205,000 \\n  Uncollectible accounts written off \\n(60,000) \\n \\n(5,000) \\n  Returns and allowances issued \\n(286,000) \\n \\n(267,000) \\nBalance, end of year \\n$321,000 \\n \\n$442,000 \\n \\nShipping and Handling Costs \\n Shipping and handling costs are included in production costs in the consolidated income statements. \\nIncome Taxes \\nIncome taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and \\nprimarily consist of taxes currently due, plus deferred taxes (see Note 6 – Income Taxes). \\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have \\nbeen included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns using current tax rates.

The \\ntax provision in any period will be affected by, among other things, permanent, as well as temporary differences in the \\ndeductibility of certain items, in addition to changes in tax legislation. As a result, the Company may experience \\nsignificant fluctuations in the effective book tax rate (that is, its tax expense divided by pre-tax book income) from \\n34\\x0c \\n37 \\nperiod to period.  The Company’s effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and 2020 reflect the impact of the reduced rates \\n under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. \\nComprehensive Income \\n For the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, other comprehensive income is equal to net income.  \\nReporting Segments and Geographic Areas \\nThe Company has one reporting segment, equipment for the highway construction industry. Based on evaluation of the \\ncriteria of ASC 280 – Segment Reporting, including the nature of products and services, the nature of the production \\nprocesses, the type of customers and the methods used to distribute products and services, the Company determined \\nthat its operating segments meet the requirements for aggregation.  The Company designs, manufactures and sells \\nasphalt plants and pavers, combustion systems and fluid heat transfer systems, for the highway construction industry \\nand environmental and petrochemical markets. The Company’s products are manufactured at three facilities in the \\n United States.  The Company also services and sells spare parts for its equipment. \\nFor fiscal 2021 and 2020, total revenues of $85,278,000 and $77,420,000, and total long-term assets of $12,639,000 \\nand $9,336,000, respectively, were attributed to the United States. Revenues are attributed to geographic areas based \\n on the location of the assets producing the revenues. \\nCustomers with 10% (or greater) of Net Revenues \\n No customer accounted for 10% or more of fiscal 2021 or 2020 net revenues. \\nSubsequent Events \\nManagement has evaluated events occurring from September 30, 2021 through the date these consolidated financial \\nstatements were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for proper recording and disclosure herein.  \\n \\nOn November 1, 2021, by unanimous vote of the Board of Directors of the Company and pursuant to the Company’s \\nBy-Laws, John E. Elliott was removed as CEO of the Company. As a result, the 30,000 fully vested, outstanding Class \\nB stock options issued under the 2009 Plan (see Note 11 – Shareholders’ Equity and Stock-Based Compensation) were \\ncancelled. The impact of the exclusion of these outstanding stock options on the earnings per share calculation for the \\nyear ended September 30, 2021, would have been immaterial. \\n \\nNOTE 2 – INVENTORIES \\n Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  \\nNet inventories consist of the following: \\n \\nSeptember 30, \\n \\n   2021 \\n \\n   2020 \\nRaw materials \\n$25,858,000 \\n \\n$ 14,607,000 \\nWork in process \\n6,280,000 \\n \\n3,633,000 \\nFinished goods \\n9,730,000 \\n \\n8,810,000 \\nUsed equipment \\n20,000 \\n \\n40,000 \\nInventories, net \\n$41,888,000 \\n \\n$ 27,090,000 \\n \\nSlow-moving and obsolete inventory reserves were $5,397,000 and $4,617,000 at September 30, 2021 and 2020, \\nrespectively. \\n  \\n \\n35\\x0c \\n38 \\nNOTE 3 -

The fiscal 2020 income \\ntaxes paid includes $2,050,000 of tax payments due on the filing of the Company’s Form 3115 with the Internal \\n37\\x0c \\n40 \\nRevenue Service to reflect the revenue recognition method change to the percentage of completion method for tax \\n purposes pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Sections 460 and 451(b). \\nGAAP prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial recognition, measurement, classification, and disclosure of \\nuncertain tax positions. GAAP contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The \\nfirst step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that \\nit is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.  The \\nsecond step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon \\n settlement. \\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s uncertain tax position and determining the Company’s \\nprovision for taxes. Although the Company believes the reserves of unrecognized tax benefits (“UTB’s”) are \\nreasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is \\nreflected in the Company’s historical income tax provision and accruals. The Company adjusts these reserves in light \\nof changing facts and circumstances. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had UTB’s of $150,000. There \\n were no additional accruals of UTB’s during fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. \\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to UTB’s as a component of income tax expense.  \\nThere were no additional accruals of interest expense nor penalties of significance during fiscal years ended September \\n30, 2021 and 2020. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the UTB’s with respect to certain unrecognized tax \\npositions will increase or decrease during the next 12 months. The Company does not expect the change to have a \\nmaterial effect on its results of operations or its financial position. The only expected potential reason for change would \\nbe the ultimate results stemming from any examinations by taxing authorities. If recognized, the entire amount of \\n  UTB’s would have an impact on the Company’s effective income tax rate.  \\n The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 12.5% versus 17.2% in fiscal 2020. \\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company generated $335,000 of federal research and development tax credits (“R&D Credits”), all \\nof which were used in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2020, the Company generated $421,000 of R&D Credits, all of which were \\nused in fiscal 2020. There were no R&D Credits carryforwards as of September 30, 2021 or September 30, 2020.  \\nThe Company files U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as Florida and Iowa income tax returns. The Company’s \\nU.S. federal income tax returns filed for tax years prior to fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 are generally no longer \\nsubject to examination by taxing authorities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.  \\n \\nNOTE 7 - RETIREMENT BENEFITS \\nThe Company has a voluntary 401(k) employee benefit plan, which covers all eligible, domestic employees. The \\nCompany makes discretionary matching contributions subject to a maximum level, in accordance with the terms of the \\nplan. The Company charged approximately $365,000 and $290,000 to expense under the provisions of the plan during \\nthe years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \\n \\nNOTE 8 - LONG-TERM DEBT AND ARRANGEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS \\nThe Company had no long-term debt outstanding at September 30, 2021 or 2020. The Company does not currently \\n require a credit facility. \\nAs of September 30, 2021, total cash deposits with insurance companies covering collateral needs were $85,000. \\nIn April 2020, a financial institution issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit (“letter of credit”) on behalf of the \\nCompany for the benefit of one of the Company’s insurance carriers.  The maximum amount that can be drawn by the \\nbeneficiary under the letter of credit is $150,000.  The letter of credit expires in April 2022, unless terminated earlier, \\nand can be extended, as provided by the agreement.  The Company intends to renew the letter of credit for as long as \\nthe Company does business with the beneficiary insurance carrier.  The letter is collateralized by restricted cash of the \\nsame amount on any outstanding drawings.  To date, no amounts have been drawn under the letter of credit. \\n \\n38\\x0c \\n41 \\nNOTE 9 - LEASES \\nThe Company leases certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.  Future minimum rental payments \\nunder these leases at September 30, 2021 are immaterial. Total rental expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, \\n 2021 and 2020 was $78,000 and $37,000, respectively. \\nOn August 28, 2020, the Company entered into a three-year operating lease for property related to the manufacturing \\nand warehousing of the Blaw-Knox assets. The lease term is for the period beginning on September 1, 2020 through \\nAugust 31, 2023.

There were no cash payments related to this operating lease \\n in fiscal 2020. \\nOther information concerning the Company’s operating lease accounted for under ASC 842 guidelines as of September \\n30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, is as follows: \\n \\n \\nSeptember 30, 2021 \\nSeptember 30, 2020 \\nOperating lease ROU asset included in other long-term assets \\n$785,000 \\n$942,000 \\nCurrent operating lease liability  \\n393,000 \\n328,000 \\nNon-current operating lease liability  \\n392,000 \\n614,000 \\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) \\n2.00 \\n2.92 \\nWeighted average discount rate used in calculating ROU asset \\n4.0% \\n4.0% \\n \\nFuture annual minimum lease payments as of September 30, 2021 are as follows: \\n \\nFiscal Year \\nAnnual Lease Payments \\n2022 \\n$417,000 \\n2023 \\n394,000 \\n2024 \\n6,000 \\n    Total \\n817,000 \\nLess interest \\n(32,000) \\nPresent value of lease liabilities \\n$785,000 \\n \\nNOTE 10 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \\nLitigation \\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business, none of which we believe \\nwill have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Claims made in the \\n ordinary course of business may be covered in whole or in part by insurance. \\nCOVID-19 Pandemic \\nThe Company continues to monitor and evaluate the risks to public health and the slowdown in overall business \\nactivity related to the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, including impacts on its employees, customers, \\nsuppliers and financial results.  As of the date of issuance of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company’s \\noperations have not been significantly impacted.  However, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to \\nevolve subsequent to the quarter and year ended September 30, 2021 and as of the date these Consolidated Financial \\nStatements are issued.  As such, the full magnitude that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company’s financial \\ncondition and future results of operations is uncertain.  Management continues to monitor the Company’s financial \\ncondition, operations, suppliers, industry, customers, and workforce.  If the spread of COVID-19 continues, the \\n39\\x0c \\n42 \\nCompany’s ability to meet customer demands for products may be impacted or its customers may experience adverse \\nbusiness consequences due to COVID-19.  Reduced demand for products or ability to meet customer demand \\n(including as a result of disruptions at the Company’s suppliers) could have a material adverse effect on its business \\noperations and financial performance.   \\nNOTE 11 – SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION \\nShareholders’ Equity \\nUnder the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, certain rights of the holders of the Company’s \\ncommon stock are modified by shares of Class B stock for as long as such shares shall remain outstanding.  During that \\nperiod, holders of common stock will have the right to elect approximately 25% of the Company’s Board of Directors, \\nand conversely, holders of Class B stock will be entitled to elect approximately 75% of the Company’s Board of \\nDirectors.

Based upon that evaluation, the President and the Chief Financial Officer \\nconcluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and \\n procedures are effective. \\nBecause of inherent limitations, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and \\noperated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of such disclosure controls and \\nprocedures are met and no evaluation can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if \\nany, within the Company has been detected. \\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, the Company conducted an evaluation, under the \\nsupervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s President and Chief \\nFinancial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures \\npursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b).  Based on this evaluation, the Company’s President and Chief Financial \\nOfficer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2021. \\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm \\nregarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the \\nCompany’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only \\n management’s report in this Annual Report. \\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \\nfinancial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company.  The Company’s internal \\ncontrol system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors \\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in \\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of all \\ninternal control systems no matter how well designed.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can \\nprovide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements.  \\nFurthermore, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may \\n become inadequate because of a change in circumstances or conditions. \\nIn order to ensure that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly \\nassesses such controls and did so most recently as of September 30, 2021.  This assessment was based on criteria for \\neffective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by \\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management \\nbelieves the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021. \\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \\nThe Company’s management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer, has reviewed the Company’s \\ninternal control over financial reporting.  There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial \\nreporting during the year ended September 30, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially \\naffect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. \\n41\\x0c \\n44 \\nITEM 9B \\nOTHER INFORMATION \\nNone \\nPART III \\nITEM 10 \\nDIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE \\nThe information required by this Item 10 is incorporated herein by reference to the Company’s Definitive Proxy \\nStatement for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. \\nITEM 11 \\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION \\nThe information required by this Item 11 is incorporated herein by reference to the Company’s Definitive Proxy \\nStatement for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. \\nITEM 12 \\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND \\nRELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS \\nThe information required by this Item 12 is incorporated herein by reference to the Company’s Definitive Proxy \\nStatement for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  \\nITEM 13 \\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR \\nINDEPENDENCE \\nThe information required by this Item 13 is incorporated herein by reference to the Company’s Definitive Proxy \\nStatement for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  \\nITEM 14 \\nPRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES \\nThe information required by this Item 14 is incorporated herein by reference to the Company’s Definitive Proxy \\nStatement for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  \\n42\\x0c \\n45 \\nPART IV \\nITEM 15 \\nEXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES \\n(a) \\nA listing of financial statements and financial statement schedules filed as part of this Annual Report and \\nwhich financial statements and schedules are incorporated into this report by reference, is set forth in the \\n“Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules” in Item 8 hereof. \\n(b) \\nExhibit Index  \\nEXHIBIT \\nNUMBER \\n \\n \\nDESCRIPTION \\n \\nFILED HEREWITH \\n3.1 \\n \\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation of Company, incorporated by reference \\nto Exhibit 3.1 to Registration No. 33-627(P) \\n \\n3.2 \\n \\nAmended and Restated By-Laws of Gencor Industries, Inc., incorporated by \\nreference to Exhibit 3.2 to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for \\nthe year ended September 30, 2007  \\n \\n3.3 \\n \\n \\n \\nCertificate of Amendment, changing name of Mechtron International \\nCorporation to Gencor Industries, Inc. and adding a “twelfth” article \\nregarding director liability limitation, incorporated by reference to the \\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, \\n1987(P) \\n \\n4.1 \\n \\nForm of Common Stock certificate, incorporated by reference to Exhibit 4.1 \\nto Registration No. 33-627(P) \\n \\n4.2 \\n \\nDescription of Securities Registered under Section 12 of the Securities \\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended \\nX \\n10.1 \\n \\nThe Company’s 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan, as incorporated by \\nreference to the Company’s 2009 Proxy Statement filed with the Securities \\nand Exchange Commission on Schedule 14A on January 28, 2009 \\n \\n10.2 \\n \\nForm of Agreement for Nonqualified Stock Options granted in 1986, \\nincorporated by reference to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year \\nended December 31, 1986(P) \\n \\n10.3 \\n \\n1997 Stock Option Plan incorporated by reference to Exhibit A to the \\nCompany’s Proxy Statement on 14A, filed March 3, 1997 \\n \\n10.4 \\n \\nFirst Amendment to the Stock Option Plan Agreement incorporated by \\nreference to Exhibit 10.12 to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q \\nfor the quarter ended June 30, 2005 \\n \\n21.1 \\n   Subsidiaries of the Registrant  \\nX \\n23.1 \\n    Consent of Independent Registered Public Accountants \\nX \\n31.1 \\n Certification of Principal Executive Officer Pursuant to Rule 13a – 14(a) of \\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended \\nX \\n31.2 \\n Certification of Chief Financial Officer Pursuant to Rule 13a – 14(a) of the \\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended \\nX \\n43\\x0c \\n46 \\nEXHIBIT \\nNUMBER \\n \\n \\nDESCRIPTION \\n \\nFILED HEREWITH \\n32.1 \\n Certifications of Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer \\nPursuant to 18 U.

The summary \\ndoes not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Certificate of Incorporation and our \\nBylaws, each of which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this \\nExhibit 4.2 is a part and to the provisions of the Delaware General Corporate Law (the “DGCL”). Refer to complete \\ncopies of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, and the applicable provisions of the DGCL for additional \\ninformation. \\nGeneral \\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 15,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (our “Common \\nStock”), 12,338,845 shares of which were issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2021; 6,000,000 shares of Class \\nB Stock, par value $0.10 per share (our “Class B Stock”), 2,318,857 shares of which were issued and outstanding as of \\nSeptember 30, 2021; and 300,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share (our “Preferred Stock”), none of \\nwhich were issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2020.  Under our Certificate of Incorporation, our board of \\ndirectors (our “Board”) has the authority to issue such shares of our Common Stock and our Preferred Stock in one or \\nmore classes or series, with such voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other \\nspecial rights, if any, and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, as shall be provided for in a \\nresolution or resolutions adopted by our Board and filed as designations. \\nRights of our Common Stock and our Class B Stock \\nVoting Rights \\nEach share of our Class B Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote on all matters submitted to stockholders, except \\nthat holders of our Common Stock have the right, voting as a class, to elect approximately 25 percent of our Board and \\nthe holders of our Class B Stock have the right, voting as a class, to elect approximately 75 percent of our Board. \\nWhere adjustment is required, the holders of our Class B Stock are entitled to elect 75 percent of our Board calculated \\nto the nearest whole number rounding any fractional number of five-tenths or more to the next highest whole number, \\nand the holders of our Common Stock will be entitled to elect the balance of the directors. \\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of our Common Stock and our Class B Stock, each such class \\nvoting separately as a class, shall be required on:  \\n(i) \\nany merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation; or any sale, lease, \\nexchange, or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets to or with any other person except \\nwhere such merger or transaction is with a majority-owned subsidiary of ours; or any dissolution of us; \\n(ii) \\nany additional issuance of shares of our Class B Stock other than in connection with stock splits and \\nstock dividends on shares of our Class B Stock or the exercise of stock options by holders of our Class \\nB Stock;  \\n(iii) \\nany modification, alteration or amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation; and  \\n(iv) \\nany other matters requiring a separate vote by classes provided for under the DGCL. \\n46\\x0c \\n49 \\nAny action that can be taken at a meeting of the stockholders may be taken by written consent in lieu of the meeting if \\nwe receive consents signed by stockholders having the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to approve \\nthe action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the matter were present. \\nDividends and Distributions (Including Distributions upon Liquidation) \\nHolders of our Common Stock and our Class B Stock are entitled to receive cash dividends at the same rate if and \\nwhen declared by our Board out of funds legally available therefor, subject to the dividend and liquidation rights of any \\nPreferred Stock that may be issued and outstanding. With respect to distributions other than cash dividends, all other \\ndistributions, including stock dividends and all other distributions and rights including distributions upon liquidation, \\nour Common Stock and our Class B Stock will rank equally and have the same rights, except that stock dividends and \\nstock splits of our Common Stock and our Class B Stock will be payable or made to the holders of each such class only \\nin the shares of such class. \\nRestrictions on Transfers of our Class B Stock (Conversion of our Class B Stock into our Common Stock) \\nAs more fully described below, our Class B Stock is not transferable as our Class B Stock except to certain eligible \\ntransferees including such holder’s spouse, certain of such holder’s relatives, certain trusts established for their benefit, \\ncorporations and partnerships principally owned by such holders, their relatives and such trusts, charitable \\norganizations and such holder’s estate. Accordingly, there is no trading market for shares of our Class B Stock. Other \\nthan pursuant to conversions into shares of our Common Stock as described below, the holder of shares of our Class B \\nStock may transfer such shares (whether by sale, assignment, gift, bequest, appointment, or otherwise) only to a \\npermitted transferee (a “Permitted Transferee”) defined generally as follows: \\n(i) \\n The spouse of the holder of such Class B Stock; \\n(ii) \\nAny lineal descendant of a grandparent of such holder of our Class B Stock, including adopted children, \\nand any spouse of such lineal descendant (said descendants, together with such stockholder and such \\nstockholder’s spouse, being hereinafter referred to as “such Class B Stockholder’s Family Members”); \\n(iii) \\nA trust principally for the benefit of such Class B Stockholder’s Family Members and charitable \\norganizations; \\n(iv) \\nAny charitable organization; \\n(v) \\nA partnership or corporation, a majority of the beneficial ownership of which is owned by such holder of \\nClass B Stock and/or one or more of his or her Permitted Transferees; and \\n(vi) \\nThe estate of such holder of our Class B Stock. \\nShares of our Class B Stock held by a partnership or corporation may be transferred to a person who transferred such \\nshares to such partnership or corporation (and to such person’s Permitted Transferees). Shares of our Class B Stock \\nmay, upon certain circumstances, also be transferred by a corporation or by a partnership to its successor. Shares held \\nby trusts which are irrevocable at the time of issuance of our Class B Stock may be transferred to any person to whom \\nor for whose benefit principal may be distributed under the terms of the trust and such person’s Permitted Transferees. \\nShares held by all other trusts may be transferred to the person who established such trust and such person’s Permitted \\nTransferees. Shares held by estates of Class B stockholders may be transferred to Permitted Transferees of such Class \\nB shareholders. \\nAny transfer of shares of our Class B Stock not permitted under our Certificate of Incorporation will result in the \\nconversion of the transferee’s shares of our Class B stock into shares of our Common Stock, effective as of the day on \\nwhich certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer on our books. \\nConversion Rights Applicable to Our Class B Stock  \\n47\\x0c \\n50 \\nOur Class B Stock will be convertible on a share-for-share basis at all times other than while our stock transfer books \\nare closed for any purpose. Any shares surrendered for conversion while the stock transfer books are closed will be \\nconverted immediately upon reopening the stock transfer books as of the day such shares were surrendered for \\nconversion. Holders of our Common Stock are not entitled to exchange or otherwise convert shares of our Common \\nStock into shares of our Class B Stock. Shares of our Class B stock are also subject to conversion in the event of \\npresentation for transfer to other than a Permitted Transferee, as outlined above, and automatic conversion as outlined \\nbelow. \\nAutomatic Conversion of Our Class B Stock \\nAll shares of our outstanding Class B Stock will be converted into shares of our Common Stock on a share-for-share \\nbasis automatically and without further action of our Board or the holders thereof if at any time (i) the number of \\noutstanding shares of our Class B Stock as reflected on our stock transfer books falls below 100,000 shares, or (ii) our \\nBoard and the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class B Stock approve the conversion of all of the \\noutstanding shares of our Class B Stock into our Common Stock. In the event of such conversion, certificates formerly \\nrepresenting outstanding shares of our Class B Stock will thereafter be deemed to represent a like number of shares of \\nour Common Stock. \\nOther \\nOur currently outstanding Common Stock does not carry any preemptive rights enabling a holder to subscribe for or \\nreceive shares of stock of any class or any other securities convertible into shares of our stock. We deliver to the \\nholders of our Class B Stock the same information and reports which we deliver to holders of our Common Stock. We \\nexpect our Common Stock to remain registered under the Exchange Act but do not intend to register our Class B Stock \\nunder the Exchange Act unless such registration is required by law.  \\nTransfer Agent \\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Common Stock is Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company. \\nPreferred Stock \\nOur Board may, without further action by our stockholders, from time to time, direct the issuance of shares of our \\nPreferred Stock in series and may, at the time of issuance, determine the rights,  preferences and limitations of each \\nseries. Satisfaction of any dividend preferences of outstanding shares of our Preferred Stock would reduce the amount \\nof funds available for the payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock. Holders of shares of our Preferred \\nStock may be entitled to receive a preference payment in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of us \\nbefore any payment is made to the holders of shares of our Common Stock. Under certain circumstances, the issuance \\nof shares of our Preferred Stock may render more difficult or tend to discourage a merger, tender offer or proxy \\ncontest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities or the removal of incumbent \\nmanagement. Our Board, without stockholder approval, may issue shares of our Preferred Stock with voting and \\nconversion rights which could adversely affect holders of shares of our Common Stock.  \\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws, and the DGCL \\nCertain provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, as well as certain provisions of the DGCL, may \\nbe deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter, or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a \\nstockholder might consider to be in its best interests, including attempts that might result in a premium being paid over \\nthe market price of the shares held by stockholders. These provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and \\nour Bylaws include the items described below. \\n• \\nClass B Stockholders Elect 75% of our Board. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that the holders of our \\nClass B Stockholders are entitled to elect approximately 75% of our Board.  Provisions of this type may serve \\nto delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our directors and officers. \\n49 \\nAny transfer of shares of our Class B Stock not permitted under our Certificate of Incorporation will result in the \\nconversion of the transferee’s shares of our Class B stock into shares of our Common Stock, effective as of the day on \\nwhich certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer on our books. \\nConversion Rights Applicable to Our Class B Stock  \\n48\\x0c \\n51 \\n• \\nApproval of Certain Actions. Our Certificate of Incorporation provide that certain mergers, consolidations, \\nsales of assets, and other matters be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding Common \\nStock and the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding Class B Stock, in each case voting separately as \\na class. \\n• \\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders. Our Bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called \\nonly by the President, by the President or Secretary at the request of a majority of our Board, or at the request \\nin writing of the holders of a majority of the shares of our stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at \\nany meeting at which our directors are elected. \\n• \\nStockholder Advance Notice Procedures. Our Bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals \\nbefore a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of \\nstockholders must provide timely notice in writing to the Secretary and also specify requirements as to the \\nform and content of a stockholder’s notice. These provisions may delay or preclude stockholders from bringing \\nmatters before a meeting of our stockholders or from making nominations for directors at a meeting of \\nstockholders, which could delay or deter takeover attempts or changes in our management. \\n• \\nNo Cumulative Voting. Our Certificate of Incorporation does not include a provision for cumulative voting for \\ndirectors. Under cumulative voting, a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares \\ncould be able to ensure the election of one or more directors. \\n• \\nUndesignated Preferred Stock. Because our Board has the power to establish the preferences and rights of the \\nshares of any additional series of our Preferred Stock, it may afford holders of any Preferred Stock preferences, \\npowers, and rights, including voting and dividend rights, senior to the rights of holders of our Common Stock, \\nwhich could adversely affect the holders of our Common Stock and could discourage a takeover of us even if a \\nchange of control of Gencor would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. \\nThese and other provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws are expected to discourage \\ncoercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons \\nseeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our Board. However, these provisions could delay or discourage \\ntransactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us, including transactions in which stockholders might \\notherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices. Such provisions could also limit the ability of \\nstockholders to remove current management or approve transactions that stockholders may deem to be in their best \\ninterests. \\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a \\npublicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a \\nperiod of three years after the person became an interested stockholder, unless: \\n• \\nThe board of directors of the corporation approved the business combination or other transaction in which the \\nperson became an interested stockholder prior to the date of the business combination or other transaction; \\n• \\nUpon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder, the \\nperson owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction \\ncommenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding, shares owned by \\npersons who are directors and also officers of the corporation and shares issued under which employee \\nparticipants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be \\ntendered in a tender or exchange offer; or \\n• \\non or subsequent to the date the person became an interested stockholder, the board of directors of the \\ncorporation approved the business combination and the stockholders of the corporation authorized the business \\ncombination at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the \\noutstanding voting stock of the corporation that is not owned by the interested stockholder. \\n  \\n49\\x0c \\n52 \\nA “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales, and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the \\ninterested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with \\naffiliates and associates, owns, or within the prior three years did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock. \\nSection 203 of the DGCL could depress our stock price and delay, discourage, or prohibit transactions not approved in \\nadvance by our Board, such as takeover attempts that might otherwise involve the payment to our stockholders of a \\npremium over the market price of our Common Stock. \\n \\n50\\x0c \\n53 \\nEXHIBIT 21.1 \\nGENCOR INDUSTRIES, INC.
